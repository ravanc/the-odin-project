      <h1>Why I want to be an Entrepreneur</h1>
      <p>
        Many people, at 21, are still figuring out what they want to do with
        their lives. I (sort-of) started to figure it out since I was 18, and
        often tell this story to other people. I think a lot of it centres
        around what your goal is, and here is mine.

      Part 1: Entrepreneurship<br /><br />
      2 years ago, when I was J2, I was having coffee. It was my morning ritual,
      to grab a char siew bao and a hot kopi O kosong gao, and have some morning
      chatter with my 2 friends before we go to our separate classes. That day,
      I arrived slightly earlier, and sat alone as I thought about my life.
      <br /><br />
      I pondered, “why am I even doing all this?”, with ‘this’ referring to
      studying till my wits end every day, with no end in sight. This was the
      beaten path for every slightly more intelligent person in Singapore —
      study hard, enter JC, then university, get a good job, and retire early.
      What would I do after? Travel the world? It all felt pretty selfish to me,
      to just globe-trot myself, and perhaps with my family, because it felt
      like I am living in my own world, benefitting myself, when this world is
      clearly more than that. It made me wonder, what was I made for? Because I
      don’t think that I was brought into this world for no reason, and neither
      should you think so. I then believed that I was brought into this world to
      make a difference in this world, leave my mark, as big as possible. That
      would be my legacy. <br /><br />

      I often reference the movie ‘Coco’ when I talk about this point, because
      the message in the movie really resonated with me: that you die once in
      your physical form, then you die again when everyone on this Earth forgets
      about you. This scared me metaphysically. It reinforced the belief that I
      wanted to leave a legacy in this world. But who would want to leave a
      legacy built off of infamy? I started searching for means to impact
      positive change. <br /><br />

      Back in J2, I used to study about Environment and was reading on US
      Politics for GP. I was studying Economics as well, which espoused 3 main
      players in an economy — the government, the firm, and the individual.
      Hence, combining the two subjects, and applying it to an issue like the
      environment, I thought about the various roles the stakeholders played in
      this issue. The US government, one of the most powerful ones in the world,
      and very much liable for past emissions, is facing political gridlock due
      to bureaucratic inefficiencies, due to partisanship, and due to lobbying
      by companies in big Oil. Whereas, the individual, as much as one wants to
      make a change in the flight against climate change, is rather helpless
      when juxtaposed with the emissions and pollution by entities such as MNCs.
      Lastly, firms. Firms to me, are the most responsible for climate change,
      because of how careless firms are with their pollution. I won’t expound
      more about how they are responsible, because Google can do that for me.
      They are also the ones doing the lobbying, ensuring that the status quo
      does not change. <br /><br />

      Hence, because of their influence in issues like this, the way forward for
      me to make impact would be to be an entrepreneur. I believe that one would
      not be able to go far trying to change a culture in an MNC. This was the
      spark that made me think about entrepreneurship. <br /><br />

      Part 2: Technical abilities<br /><br />

      Elon Musk was someone that came to mind when I talked about entrepreneurs.
      What struck me about Musk, was the fact that he was extremely
      participative in the product design of his multiple companies, namely
      Tesla and SpaceX. <br /><br />

      A key anecdote would be the selection of materials for his rocket ships in
      SpaceX. While conventional wisdom was to pick carbon fibre for the rocket
      for its light weight and strength, Musk, being the materials scientist and
      engineering guy that he is, went to calculate, insist and tested the
      hypothesis that stainless steel would make a better material. He came out
      on top of the debate. His penchant for design Tesla was also impactful to
      me, emphasising the importance of the user experience of the driver and
      its passengers. None of the materials creaked and wobbled, everything was
      sleek and hefty. That was what gave Tesla its premium feel, and what made
      it the choice of electric cars in its hey day.<br /><br />

      Elon Musk is the reason why I believe that a CEO or founder should
      absolutely know what is going on in his company, and what he is selling.
      <br /><br />

      On the other hand, computer science was the winner for me in terms of
      fields, because in theory, it is one of the lowest cost companies that can
      be started and run. I will caveat that this is for businesses. One cannot
      innovate in deep tech without a lot of capital. On the other hand, if you
      wanted to make a website which sold a small service, it just takes a week
      of intense coding, and hosting it on something like Amazon Web Services.
      Compared to the capital needs of rental, inventory and warehouse, ‘tech’
      businesses were definitely the way to go. On the innovation front, there
      is much to be discovered in deep tech. In the same metaphor as Paul
      Graham, I believe that there are many buds to break through in the many
      buds of the deep tech fractal. Computer science is here to equip you to
      break through that bud. <br /><br />

      Part 3: Personality fit<br /><br />

      I always had a rebellious streak within me. Maybe I thought I was just
      ‘divergent’ in that sense, and it did get me into a lot of trouble along
      the way, through primary, secondary school, and in the army. <br /><br />

      I also had a thing for improvising things when came the time. I cannot
      give you many examples now, but many of my improvisations I am proud of.
      Someone called me ‘MacGyver’. That was a really high praise for me, and
      you will just have to take my word for it.<br /><br />

      Until I started reading about founders such as Elon Musk and Steve Jobs,
      who, when you listen to their childhoods, make you wonder what is wrong
      with these people. But it resonated with me, because it felt like what I
      had experienced along the way of my childhood as well. <br /><br />

      I do not have much to say in this section, because it feels very
      self-diagnostic, and hence feels like self-praise to me. As the saying
      goes, self-praise is no praise. But I believe that my rebelliousness, my
      scrappiness, my disability to work for others who I don’t think are better
      than me, and my disturbed personality in general, makes me think that I
      was made to do this. <br /><br />

      This is why I want to be an entrepreneur, and this is why I study computer
      science.<br /><br />
