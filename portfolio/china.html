      <h1>My Trip to China</h1>
      <p>
        This blog was written almost daily during my trip to China. It was
        intended for me to look back upon in the future, and to reminisce about
        my first solo trip, the challenges, fun, conversations and
        introspections I may have had. Note that this is essentially unedited,
        so there may be raw thoughts that were representative of me.
        <br /><br />

        particularly insightful, for be it entrepreneurship, China, and life in
        general, click on the links below:

      Fabian … and every unnamed individual that I have met along the way in my
      time in China
      <br /><br />
      This is the story of my trip to China that started out as a 5-day holiday,
      which turned into a rather interesting 18-day adventure. You may see the
      word ‘interesting’ many times throughout the course of this text, but I
      only use this word because I was unable to find the right words to express
      what I mean at that point in time.
      <br /><br />
      <a id="day-0">Day 0: May 15</a>
      <br /><br />
      It was a hectic day today. Last minute buying a jacket, going for the
      interview, Ag+, getting chastised for my choice of gifts. Seems like my
      lucky streak has come to an end. But I shan’t let this dampen my spirits
      for the rest of the trip.
      <br /><br />
      This entry should be a ‘goal-setting’ for myself, a check-in before the
      trip. Although I think it is a bit pointless, but I think it’s worth
      looking back on.
      <br /><br />
      The purpose of the trip I have been explaining to others, is to see the
      greater markets. 7.6 million compared to 1.3 billion. The scale of the
      vision of the products are bound to be different, and so is the work
      ethic. That is what I am out to see.
      <br /><br />
      Apart from that, there will also be sightseeing and learning from others.
      Speaking to 3 people a day may be too much, so maybe I will try 2. But
      reflecting every day is definitely a must.
      <br /><br />
      My mood towards this trip is somewhat hesitant and fearful, underlying
      which is a sense of excitement for being able to explore somewhere foreign
      alone, and therefore quickly. Attempts to plan out an itinerary fell
      through, because of how difficult I find it to look for places online on
      Google, and especially when they are in Chinese. So I will just figure it
      out along the way. That is life, isn’t it? So long to the ‘plan
      everything’ part of me I guess.
      <br /><br />
      <a id="day-1">Day 1: May 16</a>
      <br /><br />
      It has been a really eventful first day. I took 2 beers prior to the
      flight in a bid to make the flight pass by quickly but it sadly made
      things worse. First of all I did not expect the Chinese on the flight to
      be so unruly, cutting queues and just defying the rules on the flight. The
      lady beside me also decided to take up a variety of yoga poses in order to
      get herself to sleep. It ended up in me getting around a maximum of an
      hour’s worth of sleep.
      <br /><br />
      Immigration was funny as well, the 2 ladies in front of me facing troubles
      with the immigration officer, and myself passing through in less than 2
      minutes.
      <br /><br />
      I landed not knowing how to travel using Metro and whether my eSIM worked
      or not but I got it worked out before 6. I ended the day being an expert
      at Alipay hahaha.
      <br /><br />
      After hauling my ass through train and micro sleeping during the ride, I
      showed up to the hostel not being able to check in because it was too
      early. So I had 6 hours to burn. I got up, left, and got on a bike, biking
      to Lujiazui and taking a few photos before I went into the coffee place. I
      asked if the shopkeepers knew how to speak English, and a lady spoke to me
      in English and that was what made my first local interaction. We talked
      about Singapore, LKY, holiday destinations and then she recommended me a
      place to eat. I was delighted by the interaction, not so much by the food.
      So right after the interaction, I put down my bike and left for the
      temple. I had diarhoerra in the temple and then walked around the whole
      region, talking to the toilet manager and buying a packet of cigarettes.
      By the time I was done with that whole lot of nothing, it was around 1pm
      and I came back to check in.
      <br /><br />
      I checked in to a room with 2 people in it. One pretty friendly guy who I
      talked to about our lives, finding out that he is a ’01 guy who played
      Overwatch competitively for a living. He said that he did not go to
      university, and had the most interest in sports management and that sort.
      I pushed him to explore more pathways, and he claimed that he sucked at
      studying. This other guy only came out when I offered him a smoke, and he
      felt pretty insidious. He did not speak much, and he was trying to observe
      how much I had in my wallet.
      <br /><br />
      I took a shower and left for NYU Shanghai, and tried to find students to
      talk to, but ended up talking to the most beautiful person I have met in a
      long while, with amazingly hazel eyes and cute giggles, I did not realise
      how beautiful she was until my conversation with her had finished. I ended
      up sitting around the area waiting for nothing and getting side-eyed by a
      group of cadence runners, so I left for my next stop, The Bund.
      <br /><br />
      While walking to the metro station, I was distracted by this really long
      looking mall which I wanted to eat from, so I ended up exploring its
      contents. It was a brand-heavy mall with crazy high prices in every store
      of the mall, topped with elements of sports and running presumably because
      it is located at the Sports Centre metro station. There were a few nice
      views to be caught from there, and rich people to watch. I left with an
      empty stomach after about an hour of walking.
      <br /><br />
      Afterwards, I reached The Bund. It was still slightly bright out, and the
      lights of the buildings were not turned on yet. I quickly saw a blonde
      mother-daughter duo and immediately sprang into action, offering to take a
      photo for them if they took one for me. I did not test the angle,
      lighting, or give them any specific instructions which led to rather
      dismal results. I was not going to have that for the amount I was dressed
      up for this photo, so I walked around more hoping to find more
      international duos which I could snag for a photo. I internally debated
      asking a Chinese pair of girls for 15 minutes straight, and ended up
      losing that so I went to sit down to sulk for a bit. After a long moment
      of not looking, I looked up and saw a blonde girl in pink sweats. I
      immediately upped and asked her to take a photo of me, and she agreed. I
      gave her the instructions for how I wanted the photo to turn out, and she
      ran with it. She started speaking Chinese to the locals which shocked me,
      and took many photos of me, whilst at the same time claiming the was not
      good at photos. After I claimed my phone from her, she surprisingly
      started walking with me, so I continued the conversation with her,
      eventually learning that she is a 26 year old Russian who stays in Bali,
      and was her final night in Shanghai. She studied in Russia and China in a
      city that is not Moscow (pronounced moss-ko, and not moskau like the song
      would suggest for you to think. She does Bigolive for a living.
      Afterwards, I went back and forth, asking her for a photo and asking her
      if she wanted the photo and for her name. It was Anisya. I suppose that
      the seeming desire for me to have repeated conversation with her made me
      look interested in her, so she offered up her WeChat. I mean, if any
      pretty girl offers up her number I have no qualms taking it. So I did.
      <br /><br />
      I left skipping with joy and went to meet up with my bunkmate from the
      hostel and we went to a nearby mall to look for food, before settling on
      Xinjiang skewers. I thought they tasted fine, but he kept exclaiming that
      it was tasteless and bad, saying that it was a long time since he 踩泥-ed.
      Sadly the conversation did not go as well as how the afternoon
      conversation went, with myself stumbling over Chinese and failing to
      understand his Chinese for more than half the time. He ended up paying for
      the meal, and I felt really bad because he rejects almost every advance
      for me to pay or to go for another meal with him. I guess the conversation
      was that bad. But I guess the only way forward is to forget him in the
      annals of my mind.
      <br /><br />
      I took the leftover skewers back to the hostel, and found the biggest
      group of people sitting in the open area, giving them the box of meat. The
      girl sitting down asked me to sit with them, so I took out my laptop and
      sat with them. When they saw my laptop, she started whispering about how
      there was shady stuff going on in the hostel, and that I should always
      secure my belongings (that need was made rather obvious to me when one of
      the roommates asked me how much cash I actually had in my wallet during my
      conversation with the other two roommates). I soon found out that the
      group I talked to had a variety of backgrounds. There was Jesse, a 38 year
      old Finnish man who works as a male nurse and a technician. With 5
      vocational degrees and hands covered with tattoos, he sported crazy
      stories about being involved in bar fights where bars were arsoned and
      having supplied someone with dynamites which turned into a bomb vest. And
      then there was this tall Chinese guy who was the only one who could speak
      both English and Chinese fluently. He graduated from a Canadian university
      in Ontario which I did not hear of, with a degree in Mechanical
      Engineering. He returned to China due to dismal job market conditions,
      while the rest of his friends moved to the US. He had a perception of a
      boring Singapore supplanted by the front desk worker who was an
      ex-regular, so I told him a bit more about the economic history and BTO
      policy in Singapore, which he managed to steer the conversation
      sufficiently well. Playing Teamfight Tactics with him, was Spencer, who
      graduated from NYU Stern in Business, and ran a drop-shipping business
      covering many regions. He spoke English, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Korean,
      and was in general rather quick witted. He is a brotherly figure who
      offered me refuge from the room with the thief. The girl who asked me to
      sit down was mysterious for a big part of the conversation. It turned out
      she was a music teacher and was concerned with her job security, offering
      other details such as her brother having started a business in Singapore
      and her sister being part of a special force or division stationed in the
      Xinjiang area. Beside her was her close friend, who identified herself as
      LinLin or something, who recently had her parents visit her from where
      they stayed, close to the North Korean border. She brought some beef
      ligament thing and offered it to me. I couldn’t say no, so I ate it but I
      could not appreciate the texture of the meat. I basically sat there
      inhaling second hand smoke and drinking till I almost passed out from both
      the alcohol and 1 hours’ worth of sleep I had in the past 48 hours, so I
      retired back in my room.
      <br /><br />
      Overall, it was definitely an eventful first day. Probably in part due to
      the fact that my day lasted 21 out of the 24 hours in that day as well. I
      think it set a good tone for the rest of the trip, where I am welcome to
      approach people and learn about them, their stories and their
      recommendations. I guess I didn’t have much takeaways in terms of
      business, but I learnt that many are pretty disillusioned out there with
      the way things are going and therefore lack ambition. I guess to have
      someone as ambitious and seemingly bright as me pass by in their life is
      interesting to them, and I really hope that they would find something
      within themselves to pick themselves up and achieve their bigger purposes
      and desires.
      <br /><br />
      <a id="day-2">Day 2: 17 May</a>
      <br /><br />
      My nose started running and eyes started tearing at 7am. A usual start to
      the day. I woke up fully at 9, taking my laptop down to the outdoor common
      area to complete my entry for yesterday. I had breakfast with 福来, the
      friend born in ’01, and managed to pay for the meal. I had dough fritters
      with soy milk which came in a bag, and a massive bowl of noodles. It is
      really interesting how far China has come from the Great Famine to one
      that is okay with throwing out noodles by the bowl.
      <br /><br />
      I was nervous for the meeting with Mr Sean Xin. He was the only bigwig
      meeting I had arranged this whole trip so I had to make it count. I sat
      around the hostel till it was 1 and started moving out. I took a taxi to
      his office, and during the ride he drove like a madman. Sudden braking and
      changing of lanes, jamming the brakes when the car in front of him blocked
      him from being able to cross the stop line. I paid $5 for this trip, so
      that should have been what I expected.
      <br /><br />
      I sat down at LB Coffee, ordering an iced americano for myself. When Mr
      Sean came, I recognised him at an instant, and him to me as well. I handed
      him the Bacha coffee straight away, not even shaking his hand. An awkward
      sequence of asking him which seat he prefers and an off the cuff
      introduction ensued, but I got to find out he was from 10S6A back in the
      day. I finally opened my MacBook and started asking him the questions I
      had prepared. Here is a summary of the questions I asked and took note of,
      paraphrased because I cannot remember word for word.
      <br /><br />
      Q: Where can I find events where people meet for business things?<br />
      A: I don’t really attend these types of events because they are usually
      full of shit and scams, so I don’t know any platforms. However, 奇迹创谈,
      the Chinese equivalent of YC, is a good platform for you to meet people
      and talk.
      <br /><br />
      Q: How about start-up cafes, where people like to gather and do their
      work?<br />
      A: People in Shanghai just don’t really like to gather for some reason.
      <br /><br />
      Q: What is the start up environment in China like, is it tough because of
      the government? I also heard of the saying that it is hard to compete
      against the incumbents so it is a ‘join or die’ situation. Is it true?<br />
      A: It depends on what you are dealing with. If you are dealing with
      products like EdTech, then of course you will face problems with
      regulations. Demand greatly fell after the ban on those tools. On the
      other hand, if you are dealing with things such as semiconductors, you
      will definitely need to deal with the government because of how important
      it is. On whether it is really ‘join or die’, that is not really the case.
      It is true that the incumbents try to do everything themselves. So when a
      competitors comes up, they have 3 steps. First, they will try to establish
      a division within their company and try to create the product themselves.
      If it fails, then they will try to buy the company and a low price. If
      that fails, then they will try to buy the company at a more suitable
      price. Whereas in the US, teams know their clear boundaries in terms of
      what they are capable of doing and would not burn money in trying to
      establish their own division. They will buy the company if they know that,
      just like in the Instagram acquisition.
      <br /><br />
      Q: I recently read a paper about how VC’s think, <br />
      A: Wow, you read a lot. Is it by Steven Kaplan?
      <br /><br />
      Q: Yes, it was.<br />
      A: He was the go-to guy for private equity academia. I took a class under
      him.
      <br /><br />
      Q: So in the paper, it says that VCs look at the founding team of a start
      up the most. Do you agree?<br />
      A: Yes.
      <br /><br />
      Q: So what do you look for in a founder?<br />
      A: We look for people who (1) communicate and articulate well, (2) have
      experience, such as working in a big tech company, where you may encounter
      problems that happen at scale, or a track record of starting up and (3)
      have good management abilities. (2) is such that founders know what is
      coming during the journey since they have encounter and managed it before.
      We also try to put the founder under pressure by asking many questions and
      challenging them, not for the purpose of having a debate, but to see how
      they handle under pressure. For the greater teams, we try to see if they
      have worked together before and have good synergy, and whether each of the
      people have clear scopes of work.
      <br /><br />
      Q: Do you think I should go for incubators like Antler?<br />
      A: I think the pros outweigh the cons. Even though they may give you 50k
      which is small money for a relatively large portion of equity, I think the
      coaching and talking to people there can help a lot. Especially when the
      coaches are experienced and they understand your problem well, or relate
      well with you, you can really click with them and get things done.
      Incubators bet in the general direction a market is moving, followed by
      the idea and the human capital. In the last two years, YC has been taking
      almost full classes of AI products, because they know the market it headed
      in that direction.
      <br /><br />
      Q: I was thinking of working for a VC so that I can be exposed to pitches,
      demo days, and learn vicariously from the founders by looking at their
      plans. However, just this week, I went for an event and heard that those
      who are looking to start up should not work for a VC, because as a VC you
      have to think as negatively as possible while as a founder you have to
      stay positive. Do you agree?<br />
      A: I have a lot to say about that. Do you want to go upstairs and talk
      about it? Because the people behind you are really noisy as well.<br />
      Q: I would be glad to.<br />
      A: Good founders, like I mentioned earlier, have the traits of [refer to
      earlier]. However, to be good at doing VC, you must have a lot of
      connections, in places where not many people are allowed to go. You
      shouldn’t be a VC then a founder if you were looking to do VC for a long
      time. Doing a VC internship is fine.
      <br /><br />
      Q: Indonesia and Vietnam are the next frontiers for business as emerging
      markets. Do you think I should do NOC in ASEAN, or in Silicon Valley?<br />
      A: I think there is no difference between the two. <br />
      Q: But I feel that I would not be able to fully understand the culture in
      those markets in the short time over there. But I think I would be able to
      absorb the high talent density and drive and craziness for start ups from
      Silicon Valley.<br />
      A: Then just go to Silicon Valley.
      <br /><br />
      Q: What was your experience like in Chicago Booth?<br />
      A: It was good. The Chicago Booth MBA program is a more academic MBA
      program. If you are interested in technopreneurship, you should go for the
      Stanford MBA or one in the same region. One way or another, SV will have
      an effect on the curriculum there. But I don’t think going to business
      school is necessary for anyone at all. If you want to take a Master’s
      program, do it for a technical skill. It used to be the case where anyone
      with an MBA is basically guaranteed a managerial position. That was what
      gave rise to the popularity of MBA. But nowadays, we place more emphasis
      on technical skills.
      <br /><br />
      Q: During my Stanford interview, the interviewer recommended for me to
      take up a INSEAD MBA. What do you think of INSEAD?<br />
      A: They’re good for Asia.
      <br /><br />
      Q: But aren’t they French?<br />
      A: Yes, but they just are popular in Asian countries for some reason.
      <br /><br />
      Q: What are your views on co-founders?<br />
      A: Our company does not really look too fondly upon trios of founders.
      Solo or paired up co-founders are fine. But we still lean towards having a
      pair of founders.<br />
       Q: How should someone find co-founders?<br />
      A: If you visit sites like AngelList, they let you look for investors and
      co-founders. You can find co-founders in matching programs. That being
      said, we do not really recommend sourcing for co-founders that way. You
      should have co-founders that are your classmates, friends, or even friends
      of friends. The key word is here trust, trust is the most important.
      <br /><br />
      Q: My friends are all smart, and I believe they can do great things in a
      start up. But more often than not, they are more inclined towards getting
      a good job and retiring comfortably. How do I find a co-founder that
      way?<br />
      A: Do you listen to talks by Jensen Huang? The recent speech he gave at
      Stanford talked about the elite students of the class being too afraid to
      take risks because they are guaranteed to live a good life after
      graduation. It’s a really accurate depiction of what is happening now. I
      think that the current market is conducive for starting up. During the
      pandemic while interest rates were low and the cost of borrowing is less,
      more people borrowed to start their own businesses. But now that interest
      rates are higher, less people borrow and hence start their own company.
      Therefore I think it is a good time to start businesses.
      <br /><br />
      Q: Do you think it’s better for me to reach the cutting edge of the
      fractal, or start trying to make other businesses within the fractal?<br />
      // Answer was lost Q: What about tarpit ideas? How would you know whether
      what you are dealing with is a tarpit idea?<br />
      A: There is a difference between a pain point, and an ‘itch’ point. An
      itch point refers to problems which are inconveniences where there are
      ‘nice-to-haves’, but people are not inclined to pay much for it.
      <br /><br />
      // Splitting it into 4 quadrants, with the 2 axes being ‘Severity of
      problem’ and ‘Size of problem’. Pain points which many people face are the
      best for investments, but it is likely that that space is saturated with
      big players. Itch points that many people face are dangerous investments,
      because it may seem like a pain point, but once founders create a solution
      and find that no one uses it, it does not turn out well. Itch points
      pertaining to a small group of people is out of the question. This leaves
      pain points which few people face. These are the optimal kind of problems
      to deal with, because the space is not too competitive yet, and you can
      expand your offerings as you go. Kind of like what Peter Thiel talks about
      in Zero to One.

      // Other remarks
      <br /><br />
      On expertise:<br />
      He shared that VCs value subject matter expertise. He said that the VC
      hired him because of his past experience at Microsoft working on what
      became Microsoft Azure’s cloud database system, which was what gave him
      the edge in examining the imminent cloud computing boom. He shared that
      these people, who have had faced the problem at scale, would likely be
      good at solving similar problems in the start up.
      <br /><br />
      On innovation:<br />
      Draw another matrix, with its axes being new-old ideas, and new-old
      problems. What VCs are most interested in are companies which deal with
      old problems, new solutions. This is because the addressable market
      already exists and is validated. What VCs are the most scared of, are new
      problems with new solutions, because on the problems front, the problems
      being addressed may just be an itch point (refer to the above matrix), and
      on the solution front, new solutions are riskier in general. With old
      solutions, old solutions and old markets are simply businesses who play to
      compete. Great execution toes the line of innovation, and might just be
      considered as a new solution. VCs do not really exist to invest in
      businesses. On the other hand, old solutions to new problems, are rather
      ideal as well, because old solutions are proven to work. The problem lies
      therein addressing the market.
      <br /><br />
      I took down a few more lines of remarks which I could not remember the
      context of:<br />
      “Don’t strive for perfection.”<br />
      “To know when to fail and know when to start” (you should start your start
      up if you know you are the one to do it)<br />
      “Talk to the real expert, or someone who understands your needs or really
      cares for you”
      <br /><br />
      // End of remarks
      <br /><br />
      After the conversation, I took the train down to Nanjing Road West and
      walked the entire distance to Nanjing Road East. I would not say there’s
      anything unexpected over there. It is a shopping district and I do not
      really shop much so it was just a 打卡 experience. Afterwards, I went back
      to the hostel and had some trouble with ordering food, so Jack did it for
      me and I paid him. It was an okay tasting fried rice, I guess it can be
      considered good in Singapore. Jesse was just leaving right as I arrived at
      the hostel as well.
      <br /><br />
      I had arranged to drinking with Spencer and JJ from Malaysia at 10pm, but
      JJ did not show up in time so we left without him. We went to the actual
      French Concession where it was lined with bars and pretty women, but they
      were not really my type (probably because they drinking). They were called
      路吧 because people mostly drank out on the pavement of the storefront,
      and smoked there. Most shops had a crowd outside them, but there were some
      shops that were quieter, and hosted pets. I took notice of a bar which was
      really quiet, almost like a reading club. If it weren’t for Spencer and
      his overactive face hole, I think I would have wanted to go in there and
      have a conversation. Which brings me to my next point in the experience.
      Even though he was really forthcoming and might I even say was a
      caricature of the American ‘outgoing-ness’, there were times where he was
      really tone deaf especially towards white people. I couldn’t help feeling
      endangered following him, but I guess his belligerence acted as a
      deterrence. The drinks were of increasing exoticness. We started with a
      gin and tonic, followed by peach flavoured beer, and a tapped fruity beer,
      ending with ‘cocktails on tap’. The last one was especially trippy. The
      bartender looked slightly androgynous, with tinges of female features
      which made me conclude she was female. She looked a bit like policewoman
      Clarissa with the addition of a bunch of piercings and tattoos, which did
      make me feel some sort of way. Not attraction or pity per se, but a bit of
      both. She looked like she had a really tough past. The rest of the
      customers were equally as exotic, but her resemblance was what stood out
      to me. Spencer and I had a tough time going back to the hostel as 3-4
      drivers cancelled our trips after accepting them, but we eventually found
      a amiable middle aged man to drive us back and talk to.
      <br /><br />
      Back at the hostel, we sat down with the usual group, but there was
      something about the energy that was different. I wasn’t really feeling it
      so I went back to sleep.
      <br /><br />
      <a id="day-3">Day 3: May 18</a>
      <br /><br />
      I started off the day with a run with Spencer. I thought I would have been
      able to perform better in the cold but I was just able to run a 4:40
      kilometre which is terrible.
      <br /><br />
      I came back and talked to the Singaporean guy and learnt a bit more about
      his life. He regretted taking up IT a lot, and was really much more
      interested in Media. Which is why when his father offered him a cushy
      government job, he decided to have the backbone to turn it down and focus
      on a career on media. I asked him if he was an artisan, like described in
      Skin in the Game. It sounds like he identifies as an artisan. He treated
      me to a cup of coffee, just as his girlfriend did not charge me for the
      bottle of water. Really appreciative for the help that people give after
      you make the effort to talk and understand them better.
      <br /><br />
      I made a post complaining about how I was struggling to find leads of
      people to talk to, but it seems right after I made that complaint, my
      prayers were answered.
      <br /><br />
      First of all, the French guy named Stan talked about wanting to go out. I
      asked him what he does, and he said he was studying Physics in France,
      working for CEA which is an agency for nuclear power. He said he wanted to
      develop his films for his camera as well. We agreed to have lunch and he
      went ahead to wash his clothes.
      <br /><br />
      A Caucasian girl sat down beside me as I was talking to Fu Lai. I asked
      her if it was her first day staying in the hostel, but it was actually her
      last night there. She is a German-French girl called Milly who studied
      cognitive sciences and computation. She had a really good command of
      English as a native German, and was interested in a bunch of deep and
      independent topics, like the brain, artificial intelligence, and social
      networks, and she is driven by her interest in the brain. She already
      received a bachelor’s degree in cognitive science and computation, but may
      be heading to Switzerland or Paris to further her studies to get a
      Master’s degree. She came to China on her way to Taipei where she was
      going to do a month-long course on Chinese etymology as she was fascinated
      by the Chinese characters after reading a course on Chinese. All in all
      she was a really smart and congenial girl. I would be lying if I said I
      wasn’t the slightest bit interested in her.
      <br /><br />
      By the time I was wrapping up my conversation with her, it had been about
      an hour of conversation, which was when I remembered about the Stan lunch
      meeting. He was waiting for me at the back all along, and I apologised
      profusely before I went up to shower. Milly overheard our conversation and
      wanted to join in on our lunch. JJ Lim joined in as well.
      <br /><br />
      I would not cover much about the lunch outing itself. I bought all of them
      food, brought them out to People’s Park to observe the marriage market,
      Nanjing Road to look at the shopping district, and just ended my time with
      them drinking yoghurt smoothies. I taught them how to use chopsticks, and
      talked to them about interesting facts and observations I had about China.
      We got harassed by some guy looking for a girlfriend/boyfriend and I found
      myself being defensive over Milly lolol. But I think it should have been a
      normal reaction for any guy when he sees a girl potentially compromised.
      <br /><br />
      After finishing our yoghurt smoothies, I parted ways with them as I still
      wanted to seize the daylight to explore the city, so I headed over to
      田子坊 and snapped a few nice photos of the buildings. I got my face drawn
      for myself and I was please my features weren’t caricatured. Or maybe he
      was just faking to be a caricature artist. I cycled over and almost died
      on the way to the 新天地 area, skidding on the road as I tried to beat a
      red light.
      <br /><br />
      When I reached 新天地, I could not find Wukang Building which was
      disappointing, and I did not end up getting many nice pictures either. I
      ended up going back to the hostel, taking away Mala on the way back during
      a transfer and Nanjing Rd West. It was an embarrassing experience not
      knowing the intricacies of separating bowls, the sub options of 麻辣香锅
      and standing at the delivery collection area. I ended up not being able to
      stomach the spiciness of the mala anyways.
      <br /><br />
      The Korean guy, Soojin, who eavesdropped and was impressed by my
      conversation with Milly, came up to talk to the table consisting of
      myself, JJ and Stan. I did not really entertain his conversation because
      it felt quite shallow, and when he left he asked if we wanted to follow
      him to get drinks. So the group of us ended up taking a separate car to
      the Found 158 area to have drinks.
      <br /><br />
      Over there, Soojin was with his friend’s girlfriend who sought to get him
      a date. At first I thought she looked like a bit of an auntie and her
      demeanour felt a bit terse. But as I talked to her more, she became more
      animated in the conversation, and was just really fun to talk to in
      general. Her name is Aurora, she works at HSBC and she does photography on
      the side. She showed me her Instagram account featuring the bunch of
      photos she had taken of her friends. When I mentioned I was interested in
      entrepreneurship, she basically suggested for me to run a business with a
      similar concept of a family office where I did concierge services for the
      Chinese who want to set up bank accounts in Singapore, since they were
      willing to pay. There was more to the conversation that is not important,
      but I somehow had some sort of her attraction despite the fact that she
      looked like an auntie and more importantly I knew the fact that she has a
      boyfriend. But her face just resembled that of the neighbour who stays two
      doors down, but younger. It is so weird seeing these faces again, because
      it feels like people living double lives, in two different parts of the
      worlds. One can always be wondering what his doppelgänger would be doing
      at any point of time.
      <br /><br />
      We sat around for about an hour before Aurora and Soojin claimed to be
      tired and wanted to go back to sleep. JJ Lin agreed afterwards and so we
      decided to go back.
      <br /><br />
      We reached the hostel before Soojin did, and when Soojin returned he came
      to strike up conversation with him. Even though I admittedly did not
      really want to start a conversation because of the previous conversation
      he has had, I humoured him which took an interesting term. We talked about
      having things to say that cannot be translated well, and then we moved
      into the reception hall to talk more. I found out that he was a post PhD
      student, and he wrote a dissertation on the demand of baseball merchandise
      in Korea, and its dependence on the baseball spectators’ experience. I
      further probed into this study, asking about the outcome of the study and
      methods he used, but it turns out his dissertation was just a proof of the
      concept that experience has bearings on demand. Through my questioning I
      also found out he was referring to price elasticity of demand. We then
      talked about education, a bit of philosophy and why I learned all these
      things despite not being related to computer science, and I think he was
      impressed by the clarity of thought I had on these things. He kept
      reiterating that he would not have expected himself to have had this
      conversation considering where he was in right now. It seems I made the
      interaction worth its while and made an impact, and hopefully offset his
      regret for not getting a girl earlier.
      <br /><br />
      During the course of typing out this reflection, a Malay man came in to
      settle his bags down, and I overheard his conversation which identified
      him as a Malaysian. Turns out he was the Malaysian businessman that I was
      told of yesterday. He was accompanied by a Chinese Malaysian, who looked
      very insidious. The Malay man was very clearly a bodybuilder, so I just
      asked him about it. He told me he was here to find a supplier for
      something, but very purposefully remained nebulous maybe because he was
      afraid I would steal his business. But upon further probing, he was going
      to do a business selling supplements similar to Tongkat Ali. All in all,
      his business models were outright shady, faking endorsements and
      regulations until they made enough to reinvest them into getting
      certified. He said ‘If you want to start a business talk to the Chinese.
      If you want to end a business talk to a Malay.’ His motivations for doing
      business sounded very selfish and disgusted me but I did not show it.
      <br /><br />
      And as I was wrapping up the reflection, another guy came up to talk to
      me. I don’t know his name. He told me he had a thin against Koreans so he
      wanted to ask about what we discussed earlier, to which I talked about his
      dissertation. He talked about the differences between different types of
      professors and about how he came from the same village as one of the top
      economics professors, so he had a very strong theoretical knowledge. He
      also said that he was one of the top 40 in his class of 500 but did not
      score well enough for TH/PK, so he ended up settling and worked in
      property sales for high value properties. He then quit his job
      prematurely, leaving him jobless now.
      <br /><br />
      It was a very interesting bunch of conversations today. These
      conversations were the centrepiece of my day. I wish I was awake enough to
      write reflections about then now but I will make an addendum soon.
      <br /><br />
      <a id="day-4">Day 4: 19 May</a>
      <br /><br />
      I decided to give myself more rest today. I slept for 6 hours instead of
      the usual 4 hours I have been getting. Once again without any plans or
      anyone to meet, I was a little sluggish in what I was doing. I washed my
      clothes for a bit and saw a mini map of what to do in Shanghai so I
      decided to visit the temple for the celestial god or something like that,
      and head over to Wukang Tower afterwards.
      <br /><br />
      I had lunch at a random shop along the street because I couldn’t be asked
      to go look for a nice store. I ordered braised chicken and they served two
      moderately hefty drumsticks and rice with vegetables mixed inside it. It
      wasn’t too bad for a random store, and the rice was an interesting take
      although it tasted a bit too grassy from the minced vegetables. The soup
      was nice though.
      <br /><br />
      I bought a Mixue drink and headed over to Yuyuan Garden. The area around
      the table was full of buildings which boasted traditional Chinese
      architecture, retrofitted with many storefronts. I had a thought about
      whether fitting those old buildings with bright and gaudy decorations and
      lights was considered bastardising the culture and history of those
      buildings. Given that China was the originator of these designs, would it
      be considered so? I felt the same subtle disgust towards the shops in
      Jingan temple as well. But doing so might just keep the culture and
      appreciation alive.
      <br /><br />
      I looked around and left, getting stopped by an old lady along the way.
      She started describing my facial features to me and claimed to be a face
      and palm reader. She said I was intelligent and was willing to let go of
      grievances. Once she said the latter I knew she was full of shit. And she
      wanted to charge me 60 yuan for a reading. I told her to go talk to
      foreigners instead.
      <br /><br />
      I walked to some random alley and took a bike going anywhere, ending up at
      Xintiandi again. I had a look at the Xintiandi Style I building and it was
      pretty nice in there. Rather West World styled interior design and I had a
      % Arabica coffee before stumbling upon the Communist museum. I decided to
      just enter and find out what was going on in there, and was greeted by a
      giant mural of Tiananmen Square.
      <br /><br />
      I went in and saw the history of Communism in China, originating from the
      poor conducting and uprising and some 5/4 Revolution by the students. It
      was interesting to think about where power lies in a society. The poor
      have nothing to lose other than their lives, and students are likely to be
      progressive and organised, which makes them ‘powerful’ groups in a
      society.
      <br /><br />
      The communist conspiracy and its organisation is also appreciable, with
      them maintaining Russian ties and sending students over to learn about
      Marxism. The original documents were also on display. I don’t know if it
      is pretentious for me to say this but you could feel the history emanating
      from those documents. I just have more appreciation for books and the
      knowledge they behold within them after I started reading more. It felt
      like the pictures I took over there told more stories than my usual
      pictures did. Before I left, I got a picture with the mural.
      <br /><br />
      People claim that Wukang Building is nearby to the Xintiandi station when
      in fact the nearest station was 2 stations down the line. But regardless,
      I would not turn down an opportunity to walk the streets.
      <br /><br />
      The architecture was mainly European, and you could get used to it after 2
      streets’ worth of walking. I passed by the Shanghai Library along the way,
      and thought that only locals could go in. So I asked the staff and they
      were happy to let me in. The interior design of the library was quite nice
      as well. You could definitely see more people interested in books in the
      library, which makes you think that the Chinese are more interested in the
      pursuit of knowledge than Singaporeans are. Or maybe pirating books is not
      as easy. I went to the foreign books section, and saw a section of books
      donated by NLB. They were many recipe books, one on Singaporean wildlife,
      and one on Zubir Said. It was notable that food was the way Singapore
      tries to spread soft power. I also talked to an Argentinian international
      schoolteacher who was there to look for Spanish books he could recommend
      to his students. He left without finding any and said he would come back
      when he had more time.
      <br /><br />
      I also passed by a bazaar and an art gallery along the way. The bazaar was
      a rather standard, except for the fact that there was a stall for adopting
      animals. The art gallery featured paintings of artistes and conductors and
      people in the classical music community. Only one other person was in the
      museum. The rest were staff and volunteers. I wonder why they had so many
      volunteers when they do not have human traffic.
      <br /><br />
      I finally reached Wukang Tower and it was chock full of people taking
      pictures of it. I felt awkward with my clothes being sweat stained and the
      colors being so contrasting. I went to the bookstore to delay having to
      take the picture and I bought a book on Shanghai architectural legacy and
      found out the building is also called Normandie Building.
      <br /><br />
      Through the conversations I had in Shanghai I found that having historical
      and geopolitical knowledge being very useful in conversations, especially
      when it pertains to them. They make for deep and thought provoking
      conversations. I then thought about how one can have good conversations in
      Singapore and concluded that being well read and well traveled makes for
      good conversation.
      <br /><br />
      Afterwards went out and took 3 pictures of the building before thinking to
      myself that it was just a building that has value seemingly randomly
      ascribed to it. Maybe there is more to the building’s history I do not
      know about, but it did not seem logical to me that that building is so
      popular.
      <br /><br />
      I biked down to Xujiahui and had a look around the malls and took a train
      down to Century Ave to have dinner. It was difficult to find food I was
      not afraid to try.
      <br /><br />
      I went back and had a drink before taking a cab with Stan down to the
      Jingan temple area for a highly rated rooftop bar but was disappointed by
      it. The live music club was also too expensive for us, so we left. I tried
      asking a pair of local girls for good bars nearby and they misled us to
      some random street. I don’t understand why they did that because I am very
      sure I asked nicely and respectfully and they could have afforded to just
      say they did not know.
      <br /><br />
      I navigated to where Spencer and I visited a few days ago and found the
      Atlas bar which I appreciated as a quiet bar when we passed by it the
      other day.
      <br /><br />
      There was a trio sitting within. A lady with blonde bob cut, a Chinese
      lady, and a Caucasian man. The bob cut lady shot us a few glances so I
      initiated the conversation. I asked her if they were colleagues and they
      said yes. She introduced herself as Feng and I asked about her English
      proficiency. She used to study in the UK, so she could speak to some
      degree. The Caucasian man Andreas was Danish. They did the usual what you
      were doing here question and I did my usual interested in business answer
      and she said that they ran a fashion business. At first she introduced
      herself as the designer and the Chinese lady was the boss. But it turned
      out she was the boss. Long conversation short, I asked for bar
      recommendations and she was willing to bring us to her residential area
      where there were two good cocktail bars nearby. She suddenly remembered
      that she had a party invitation and showed it to us, asking if we wanted
      to follow. We sure did. The party was two minutes away, and you could see
      it from afar.
      <br /><br />
      Entering the party, the room was filled with a dim red light and smoke.
      Usually, this scene would have set off alarm bells in my head but somehow
      today they were disarmed. We had a look around and lost Feng and her
      friends so we had a look around. There was an almost pitch black room
      which was the dance floor, a smoking room, and a door that was controlled
      by bouncers. We suspected she went in there but we were not able to enter.
      <br /><br />
      Luckily, I saw her friend, a hefty bald man with tattoos on his arms. I
      asked where she was and he told the bouncers we were with him and they
      gave us concert bracelets and a stamp on the hand. This gave us access to
      the room which meant free flow drinks, which was great. I had a coke and
      whisky, and decided to wait outside for Feng so that we could thank her
      before she left. I set a 10 minute timer for us to know when to give up.
      <br /><br />
      During this time, I made eye contact with a Kazakh man and I asked him if
      he were French. He used to be a software engineer in Kazakhstan and he
      turned into e-commerce of cleaning products and was doing well. He said
      that e-commerce of anything would have done well in Russia. His shop was
      on the Russian e-Bay, which surprised me as I did not think a shop on an
      e-commerce site could do well. He was looking into expanding to Shopify
      soon. He mentioned he had a wife as well during the conversation, and then
      he left to buy an entry.
      <br /><br />
      The ten minutes was up and we went back up again. There were no more
      cocktails so we just drank beer. Three people sat at our table and we
      learnt that they were artists. I did not learn anything from them and they
      followed themselves on my Instagram. I only wanted to see their art and
      not follow them which pissed me off.
      <br /><br />
      What followed was just me trying to get my boy a date for 520 and I got
      someone to exchange contacts with him - but she did not reply him sadly.
      <br /><br />
      I saw Feng again in the party just as she was about to leave. I thanked
      her for us and sent her off.
      <br /><br />
      After she left, we got one more drink and left as well. We got a last beer
      and went to a FamilyMart to get some instant noodles. Had a talk with her
      and she explained that the foreigners are much more courteous to her than
      local Chinese are. This is why I don’t want old people to have to work
      next time. We got a cab and went back to the hostel and proceeded to get
      hungover really bad the next day.
      <br /><br />
      <a id="day-5">Day 5: 20 May</a>
      <br /><br />
      Today is the last day in Shanghai as part of the first leg of the trip. I
      woke up at 6am for the run I wanted to have with Stan, but had crazy
      headache and dizziness so I immediately called it off.
      <br /><br />
      I woke up at 9am instead and talked to JJ Lin and Stan. It was JJ’s last
      day at the hostel, so we had lunch together at the noodle store. I tried
      the 红烧牛肉面 and honestly the instant noodles version was better than
      the prepared noodles in every way. He called upon someone he met at the
      hostel, a Uyghur from Xinjiang. He was unemployed and was not looking for
      a job, and claimed that he spent the past month in the hostel basically
      sleeping for the entire time. He graduated after studying something about
      expo booths. I’m not really sure what his motivations in life are because
      I didn’t have lunch one-on-one with him, but within that conversation I
      just felt the insidiousness of the 躺平 culture. It is self destructive
      not only for the country, but the person as well. It would definitely be a
      good topic to study on and write an essay about, but that can wait for
      next time.
      <br /><br />
      During the conversation, Stan mentioned he wanted to visit the Old City
      and so did I, so I decided to follow him there. I asked the more
      experienced duo on where to go, and they pointed us to Zhujiajiao.
      <br /><br />
      It was a 2 hour long travel over, and I spent the two hours writing the
      reflection for yesterday because I was too shitfaced to do it yesterday. I
      think I was trying to re-evaluate the direction of my entries because for
      the first three days they were more of recollections and storytelling
      instead of putting in more thoughts into it. I’m not sure if having a more
      opinionated article is better, or it should be objective so that I can
      reflect on it afterwards every time I read the pieces. But I think I will
      just be opinionated for now, because I will probably run out of opinions
      soon.
      <br /><br />
      Zhujiajiao was just a touristy destination with not much thoughts to have
      about anyways. Interesting to have seen fried centipedes, scorpions,
      spiders and other crawlies. There were also live crickets kept in plastic
      cages, for some reason. Bought some 42% flower wine and that’s about it.
      <br /><br />
      We brought the rose wine back to the hostel and had Jay order some food
      for us. It was pretty good food, and we decided to share the rose wine
      around. I decided to just talk to the other white guy at the hostel, and
      he was a 21 year old traveller hailing from Ireland. He is an ethnic
      Russian who studied in Ireland since secondary school, and he had just
      attained a bachelor’s degree in biochemistry. His name is Alex, and he
      reads books on science in his free time. He has a slightly tall and lanky
      build with a head of long blonde hair. He is into bouldering and rock
      climbing, and is interested in neuroscience and answering the question of
      how people age. We chatted for a bit more, before deciding to start
      playing card games. When I took my cards out, I saw the two Caucasian guys
      who were sitting in the corner and asked them if they wanted to play
      cards. They agreed to play after they had finished their laundry.
      <br /><br />
      They were both German business graduates who were travelling around the
      world. David is a bear sized man who works to help the disabled in his
      spare time and likes to help people. He also has a 4 month long management
      consulting internship with Deloitte waiting for him at home. Fabio,
      despite his name, has no Italian roots. He was a more regularly sized guy,
      and does not have any work at home. Instead, he is looking into studying
      for his Masters degree.
      <br /><br />
      I think after meeting so many people, it would be good to keep a notebook
      which people can write their messages on if you have talked to them long
      enough. It would be a really cool piece.
      <br /><br />
      <a id="day-6">Day 6: 21 May</a>
      <br /><br />
      Today I had my flight to Beijing. I woke up at 4.30 to pack things up, and
      left at about 5. I slept at about 2 last night, so I was pretty sleepy on
      the way to the airport, but I think the driver was sleepy as well because
      he looked like his was dozing off once or twice towards the end of the
      trip.
      <br /><br />
      I saw a travel group which had its tourists wear yellow bucket hats in the
      airport and I thought that was rather cute. But that was definitely not
      the case. I queued up for the Southern China Airlines check-in, and I
      coincided with a hoard of those yellow hatted people and man were they
      uncivilised. Pushing, shoving, ducking under the ribbons to cut the queue,
      I was really incensed to watch it happen right in front of me and not be
      able to do anything about it. I guess the silver lining was that I was
      able to check in with a reasonably pretty front counter staff, and she
      gave me an aisle seat.
      <br /><br />
      The flight with Southern China Airlines was really pleasant as well. For a
      two hour flight, they gave us warm dim sum and a lunchbox of yoghurt and
      fruits. Seated beside me was a seemingly Russian-Chinese mother daughter
      pair, and the mother was really kind as well. When she saw that I could
      have had trouble putting down my cup into the groove of the table, she
      helped to shift the obstacle away on her own volition. I think the
      pleasantness of the flight negated whatever negative feeling I had from
      check-in. The grandeur of the airport was nice as well, with the brown and
      white colours matching well, and a conic shape resembling that of Changi
      Jewel. I grabbed a coffee and my luggage, and proceeded to have diarhoerra
      for a few times before I went to get a bus ticket to 涿州. I could not
      understand what the girl at the bus ticket counter needed from me, and she
      took out her translation device to translate her Mandarin to Thai. I
      facepalmed pretty hard when she thought I was Thai. But I ended up being
      able to board the bus in the end.
      <br /><br />
      I boarded the bus and had a really long walk to the condo. My first
      impression of the place was that it was really underdeveloped, with
      non-functional traffic lights and broken pavements. A lack of a public
      transportation system such as buses, and sharing bikes, also made
      traveling about that much more difficult. I had to cross 2 eight lane
      roads under the junction with a box replacing the traffic lights, and no
      pedestrian lights. This box switched polarities at set, short intervals,
      so the first time I crossed, I found myself between the 6th and 7th lane,
      with a big truck and a car moving towards me. At that point, I cannot
      remember if I were scared or just fed up, but I stood still and stared the
      two vehicles down. They skirted past me, and I carried on. It felt like a
      metaphor against flinching, because flinching is a sign of weakness.
      Furthermore, if you moved unpredictably whilst flinching, there would be a
      bad outcome as well. Hence my choice of not flinching.
      <br /><br />
      I went to the house and washed my clothes, skipped lunch and went straight
      to sleep for a few hours.
      <br /><br />
      The owner of the flat returned home and we talked for about half an hour
      before we headed out to have dinner at the local mall. We continued
      talking over grilled fish and beer, spanning across a wide range of
      topics. The points I found more intriguing were about:
      <br /><br />
      Welfare for elderly and chronic diseases in China<br />
      - We talked about this point when I asked why he did not want to bring his
      parents back to Singapore where the quality of healthcare may be better.
      He answered that the government has a lot of welfare programs in place for
      chronic illnesses, as well as hospital stays, with a $2000 subsidy every
      year or so and a 90% subsidy in hospitalisation. Compared to moving his
      parents to Singapore, where there is not much subsidies for them as
      immigrants, the cost greatly outweighs the benefits involved. I think this
      is a great concern for a country which recently became home of the fastest
      aging population. This will bring about great budget deficits. Which
      brings us to the next main point.<br />
      - Apart from cost, he also mentioned that he believed in the quality of
      Chinese healthcare more than that of Singapore’s. He said that this was
      because doctors learn mainly from experience, more so that from the
      textbooks, so in a country where demand of doctors outstrips the supply
      both due to high population size and low output of doctors, the average
      experience of each Chinese doctor would be higher than that of Singaporean
      doctors, which means they would be more suited to treat ailments. He also
      mentioned that doctors are overworked and underpaid. While this was an
      interesting point to have heard back then, upon further thought this is
      another dangerous proposition. Simply look at the South Korean doctors’
      strike. If there were really to be a shortage of doctors as he says, then
      the healthcare system may buckle under the aging population. Increasing
      the supply of doctors has to be done, and their wages would have to be
      increased. This would bring about greater spending on both ends - doctors
      and patients (from the increasing amounts of subsidies they have to give),
      which would be a massive budget strain. The only caveat to this issue I
      can think of is for the replacement rate of elderly to be negative.
      <br /><br />
      Tax income from tobacco industry<br />
      - When I asked where the government was able to earn all the money to
      provide welfare, I asked for the tax rate in China as well. Apparently,
      all the taxes are hidden and priced in already. On top of that, the
      government has its own ventures, such as his oil company and more
      importantly the tobacco industry. With a strong culture of smoking, China
      stands to earn a lot, back from its own citizens, in the form of profit
      from those companies as well as the consumer tax. I found this
      contradictory, as the government is the chief producer of a vice which is
      massively detrimental to health. Yet it provides healthcare benefits. I
      suppose the costs and benefits of this tobacco market is hard to
      ascertain, because tobacco has a cultural role as well. <br /><br />
      Having to reduce the income disparity to maintain social stability vs in
      the US where the poor may resort to black market activities<br />
      - On government policy, he mentioned about the move to reduce income
      disparity between the extremes, as a means to promote ‘fairness’.
      Otherwise, extended periods of disparity may lead to social unrest. I then
      wondered why the US did not see a lot of social unrest within their
      economy as well, when they try to build lean companies which eliminates
      all wastage, leading to unemployment and those likes. I at first thought
      to myself that it could have been a political thing where voters get to
      express their discontentment with their situation through voting, which
      vents the frustration of not being able to find work. However, he
      mentioned that the poor and unemployed are also more likely to turn into
      drugs, peddling drugs and the such, which are rather lucrative businesses.
      He also mentioned that the cultural factor of the ‘American Dream’ which
      espouses the value of hard work may just let the poor be more accepting of
      their own situation, taking it as a failure on their own part in working
      hard to earn a decent living. <br /><br />
      Increasing demand for Masters students due to the decreasing quality of
      education<br />
      - On hiring practices, I was told that Masters students were of decreasing
      demand, due to the influx of these students. I found it weird, as the
      increase in education of society, or so I thought, would be able to reduce
      the income disparity by making everyone do better work. However, he says
      that graduates are still evaluated holistically and are picked based on
      whichever percentile they belong to, and it will stay that way. When
      everyone has a Masters degree, then no one may as well have it. That point
      I totally agree with, but if everyone is a Masters student then I think
      the next logical step for the unemployed ones would be to go overseas for
      a job. But if they aren’t, then this is saying something about the quality
      of Masters education in China. <br /><br />
      The difference in business discussion methods, i.e. dinner table
      discussions vs over golf<br />
      - Talking about the cultural value of tobacco, we went to talk about the
      dinner table deals that take place in the East, where deals and
      discussions are done over dinner. I asked about whether golf is a popular
      option as well in China, but it seems not, because the set up for golf may
      not be beneficial for the rest of the members on the team. He likened
      these discussions to that of a game, where there has to be an opener, a
      main player, and a supporting actor in a team. With golf, it is difficult
      for the other two members to help in the negotiation, since it is more
      often than not a one-on-one situation. It would be more difficult for
      junior staffers or team members to chime in, especially when the
      conversation between the main players becomes rocky. Which brings us to
      talk about the next main point.<br /><br />
      The level of ‘democracy’ in Chinese companies whereby the junior staffers
      have a definite chance to talk, compared to other countries<br />
      - With the comfort of a dinner table, everyone is fair game. Everyone at
      the table has the chance to offer a toast, and hence speak their peace.
      Furthermore, the added bonus of alcohol is that you are able to bootlick
      and say mushy things under the pretext of being drunk. This can hence help
      to boost the connection between parties. The quality of alcohol is also
      important when ordering it, to signify respect in treating the other party
      with high quality goods. In his experience with US, Singaporean, Malaysian
      and Chinese firms, he has found that the Chinese demonstrate the most
      ‘democratic’ treatment insofar as letting everyone have their voice be
      heard. I suspect this may be because of the industry that he is in,
      geophysics, which has a relatively older worker base which subscribes to
      older forms of corporate governance, compared to the more millenial start
      ups which respects everyone’s opinions to a greater extent. However, it is
      still interesting to learn how it is done such that it could be
      implemented in company dinners next time. He also highlighted the
      importance of adapting to local cultural norms. By trying to adapt, you
      are demonstrating sincerity and earnestness, and thus would have better
      relations to the other party. Of course, the best case scenario is to have
      a local to guide you along with the cultural nuances as well.
      <br /><br />
      I promptly went back to sleep because I was too conked out from the
      cumulative sleep deprivation and the alcohol consumption.
      <br /><br />
      <a id="day-7">Day 7: 22 May</a>
      <br /><br />
      Wow a week has passed since I have reached this place. Time has seemingly
      moved pretty slow from the sheer amount of sleep deprivation I put myself
      through to try to see more of the place.
      <br /><br />
      I originally planned to take the 7.30am train into Beijing that morning,
      but when I awoke, I saw that the homeowner was still asleep, and I did not
      feel right just leaving without seeing him and thanking him one last time.
      He would be going over to Xi’an for work for the next 10 days, and I might
      just leave Beijing by then. So I just sat around for a few more hours, to
      see him leave the place and give my maybe-final words of gratitude. After
      he left, I got changed and left for the train station as well.
      <br /><br />
      It took me some time to buy a ticket as an international passport holder.
      But once I was done, I got instant noodles to eat while waiting. I was
      excited to try high speed rail, just because. When we entered the
      platform, 2 or 3 trains sped past us. I remember the first train passed by
      the whole station in about a second and a half, with the sound of the
      train being indescribable. It was a combination of loudness, and some sort
      of vibration which bores deep into your chest. You can see the train from
      afar but not hear it, and it swooshes past you as quickly as it came. I
      did some calculations and at top speed, of around 300km/h, the train is
      moving at about 80m/s, a quarter of the speed of sound. This roughly means
      that the train may very well be moving together with the sound that it
      emitted at the same moment, which makes for a rather compact ‘sound
      bubble’. I found all of this rather interesting.
      <br /><br />
      The train did not stay at top speed all the way through the journey as
      well. It only remained at 300km/h for a few minutes before maintaining
      perhaps 100+km/h for the rest of the trip. Likely because it was a short
      trip. Last point on high speed rail would be how spacious the seats are. I
      see why rail could be more expensive than air now, from the higher level
      of comfort and freedom that it offers.
      <br /><br />
      I expected my internet connection to improve once I entered Beijing but I
      was disappointed. Nonetheless, I could not let the lack of Wi-fi stymie
      the progress of my trip. I looked at the subway map, and took the train to
      the most obvious part of Beijing - Tiananmen.
      <br /><br />
      It was a weird station. I noticed that there were multiple exits, all
      outfitted with the usual couple of policemen and women, and scanners. But
      there was just a massive queue for one of them. Trying to be smart I went
      to an other exit, and tried to leave but the policeman told me that exit
      was closed. I was confused, because why are there so many people there
      when the exit is closed, and why even have an exit there in the first
      place just for it to be closed? I don’t suppose it is an extraordinary
      time of the year where many people are visiting the area, so is the exit
      closed all year round? There seemed to be quite a bit of inefficiency on
      that front.
      <br /><br />
      So I left through the other exit and tried entering Tiananmen Square.
      Seems I needed a prior booking to enter. So I tried walking down a
      different road and needed my ID to be checked. I walked around and found
      that there was nothing there other than some contemporary Chinese
      architectural buildings - short, grey and very apparent brick outlines on
      the building, with flat roofs with Chinese styled edges. The more I looked
      at them, the more they felt like a government building. Actively guarded
      by military personnel and policemen, stopping me from taking photos, and
      the entry of a black Audi which had its license plate start with V instead
      of the usual Chinese character.
      <br /><br />
      I continued walking about and saw a Chinese gate. I walked in and found
      the park, so I entered. Nothing particular to mention about, just some
      river and Chinese buildings, snapped a few pictures, languished in the
      heat, and walked out.
      <br /><br />
      I then walked towards the Chairman Mao Memorial Hall and saw the very
      massive picture of him plastered on the wall. And I thought that was
      Tiananmen Square. Guess I was wrong. Took the obligatory picture in front
      of that wall, and in exchange had to help another couple snap their photo.
      They were a nice young couple from some random part of China. I entered
      the palace walls and was once again told that I had to book in advance.
      Turns out the lady from the first day was absolutely right in talking
      about needing advance bookings. But the challenge was just knowing where
      to do those bookings, which I honestly do not care enough to search for,
      and for my mobile data is incapable of handling those mini-apps as well.
      <br /><br />
      By the time I was done snapping pictures, I was sufficiently hungry. I
      tried every way to look for a good place to eat on my phone, but the
      mobile data was not compliant with my requests. Screw it then. I will just
      find it myself. I got onto the train and looked at the map. Sihui looked
      familiar, and there are two stations for Sihui, so that should mean that
      it is quite a happening place. With that postulation, I took the train
      there. I thought about it a bit more and alighted a stop before Sihui
      station, and there it was. A mall for me to eat in. I had roasted crispy
      skin duck rice. It wasn’t too shabby. It was hella expensive though.
      <br />
       I then spent the next few moments trying to triangulate where I was going
      to have my conversations tomorrow, pleasantly surprising myself that it
      was relatively nearby. So I decided to make a pilgrimage there. I stopped
      by 2 malls, exploring them from top to bottom, getting some Bawang Chagee
      and feeling extremely bloated during the walk from the amount that I just
      ate and drank.
      <br /><br />
      I walked to Kerry Centre, then decided that it was time to head back. I
      reached the Beijing East station and bought tickets for 20:42 and 7:23 the
      next day back into Beijing. It was 17:00. I considered exploring the area
      around the station, but I wasn’t too confident in straying too far out
      with a non-functional phone. So I just sat there. Some guy sat beside me
      and started smoking. The noxious fumes were rather ob-noxious. Some
      shoddily dressed I-assume beggar came up to me and whispered to me, asking
      if I wanted a watch. I vigorously shook my head and he kept asking. I
      can’t do this any longer. I upped and left, knowing I had to stay on the
      move, otherwise I probably would have fallen asleep outside the station
      and gotten mugged.
      <br /><br />
      I took another look at the station map. Peking University East Gate wasn’t
      too inconvenient to get to, so I set my sights there. Perhaps I could pick
      up some ladies as well. I got on the train and micro-slept my way there,
      and was reinvigorated by the youthful energy of the surroundings, from
      being brought down by the literal doom and gloom, dystopian scene that I
      was just in. I observed the entrance of the university. There were
      gantries there, but there seemed to be not only students but also random
      people going into the university. This must be just a usual security
      checkpoint, I presumed, so I walked up to the gantry and asked if I just
      needed to show my identification.
      <br /><br />
      “No you need to book a week in advance.”
      <br /><br />
      “A week?”
      <br /><br />
      “Yes. A week.”
      <br /><br />
      That is ridiculous. Most people don’t stay in a country for more than a
      week. How were they supposed to know they had to book beforehand?
      <br /><br />
      “What if I know someone here?”
      <br /><br />
      “Get them to book it for you.”
      <br /><br />
      I asked him maybe one or two more questions but this bloody pimply faced
      man just totally ignored me. I was rather put off by that. So I explored
      my options while standing outside the station, beside an old lady peddling
      the school’s insignia. I thought of contacting some random guy off of
      LinkedIn, but my data did not work. What about the judo batch mate who
      went to PKU? Nah I don’t talk to her. So I resolved to ask a student.
      There were one or two pretty ones that I thought of asking but as always I
      am too shy to ask them. So when I saw another young couple walk past, I
      pounced. “Sorry are you a student here?” Somehow most people here don’t
      like to respond to questions. The guy continued staring straight and
      walking, but I was lucky the girl decided to answer my question. We
      chatted a little longer, learning that he studied a sort of science-y
      subject at PKU, whereas she was training to become a teacher at Beijing
      Normal University, most likely to teach physics. She had a really good
      command of English, always replying to me in English despite my efforts to
      steer the conversation in Chinese. In the end, he managed to register my
      name and soon enough I went in. So much for that, pimply faced guy.
      <br /><br />
      I thought the architecture there was rather nondescript and I had dinner
      there. After dinner I biked around and found the lake with the pagoda and
      snapped a few pictures before going back to the station half an hour too
      early. I took the high speed rail back to ZhuoZhou, and when I reached the
      station, I tried opening my DiDi app. It did not load for the life of me.
      And there I was facing an existential crisis, in the middle of a wasteland
      city with no communications and in the middle of the night. I did
      everything with my phone. Restarting, closing all the apps, disconnecting
      every device, trying to cool my device down further, but it was always
      still that damn white screen. I don’t know why I didn’t break down. I just
      felt despair, that’s it. I asked an old couple sitting on the same
      fountain whether I could use their app. They said they didn’t know how to
      set it up. I walked to a group of people playing badminton. He immediately
      could tell I was not local and I was pretty scared I would have been taken
      advantage of. But he was a local guy who has a shop in ZhuoZhou and he was
      really kind in helping me get a car back. I transferred him 20 dollars
      after the trip, and thanked him, he told me not to mention it and told me
      to come back there and play if I have the time. A peaceful ending to a
      rather rough start to the day. Now I thank myself for having made that
      booking for the hostel in Beijing.

      <a id="day-8">Day 8: 23 May</a>
      <br /><br />
      I didn’t get much sleep because of the timing of my train ride. I woke up
      early and left the place, making a beeline for the Grid Cafe.
      <br /><br />
      I reached and got myself a breakfast set of americano and a croissant,
      before settling down to write down the previous day’s entry. The coffee
      had a slightly strong sour taste and the croissant came late, which got
      myself and Han Min a free americano each. We sat down and got straight to
      business, since we only had about an hour to talk.
      <br /><br />
      Han Min is a year 3 business student who had a computer engineering
      background. He joined NOC Beijing as a means to immerse himself in the
      Chinese culture, to take a look behind the curtain of the world’s up and
      coming superpower. Compared to NOC SV, as the barriers to China are much
      higher than the US, tapping on the school’s Chinese connections offered
      more value to him. Hence, China. He has a strong interest in blockchain
      and its applications, able to spend a whole Saturday reading up on
      blockchain and the projects out there, eventually hoping to move to Dubai
      to start up there, where the tax rate for crypto is the lowest.
      <br /><br />
      - Spending time in Venture Debt as a hedge against interning for a failing
      start up, and to build up one’s own acumen towards funding and what
      constitutes a good start up for VCs to invest in<br />
      // I would say that I almost entirely disagree with this statement, simply
      for the fact that joining a failing start up is an experience in its own,
      and would be different from what one would learn from a VC firm. It would
      not be a waste to have joined a failed start up. Furthermore a slant
      towards funding and accounting numbers would detract you from the most
      important part of your start up, which is the product.<br />
      - China’s regulations can help your business<br />
      - Blockchain is banned in China, yet there are underground blockchain
      communities which discusses with each other about crypto. This implies
      that if you have deep enough roots and a somewhat ready project, you are
      ready to capture most of the market since you are the first to move into
      it. However, one might not want to count on this too much because it might
      just be a case where you sit waiting for a piece of regulation to fall.
      <br />
      - VC and Pessimism<br />
      - When asked about whether being in VC makes you more pessimistic, he says
      that he can see why someone would say that. However, he is able to
      separate between work and his own interests, which is why he still remains
      bullish on blockchain. Instead, VC allowed him to take a look at the
      bigger picture, the wider market, as he is exposed to many business ideas
      and therefore is able to get a pulse of the problems that people are
      facing in the industries and society. But he also mentioned that a good
      number of problems are enterprise solutions for people who were relatively
      deeper in the industries.
      <br /><br />
      After the chat, Han Min introduced me to his fellow intern, a PhD student
      in psychology, researching on language development in children. He invited
      me to take a look at Tsinghua University, which I gladly accepted.
      <br /><br />
      I rushed off to Raffles City, where I met Joan and Shi Tong at wagas, a
      salad place. I found it pretty weird that the locals each salads with a
      chopsticks, but nonetheless. They also needed to go off for work
      afterwards so our time for conversation was limited.
      <br /><br />
      Currently, they work for SmartAir which is a social enterprise with the
      goals of creating low cost air purifiers and public education about clean
      air.
      <br /><br />
      Joan is an environmental studies student, who was repelled towards the
      idea of starting businesses from ground up after her experience here and
      talking to investors. She mentioned that she was more interested in
      building products instead, presumably in a safer environment where
      financials and Human Resources do not have to be managed as actively. In
      other words, intrapreneurship at a larger firm. As a Tembusu alumni, she
      also found the Tembusu conversations interesting, but cautioned me against
      joining talks for the namesake of the speaker. In the bigger scheme of
      things, she also advised me to be very purposeful in the use of your time
      and to know what I want to get out of every talk or activity I participate
      in, since time is a commodity.
      <br /><br />
      Shi Tong is a computer science student who is interested in start ups
      because of its ability to scale solutions for societal problems. He hails
      from KL, and the education system in Malaysia does not introduce much on
      entrepreneurship, and he was intrigued by its prospects after coming to
      Singapore. He is specialising in artificial intelligence and software
      engineering in NUS, and he is involved in competitions locally in Beijing.
      His role at SmartAir is an artificial intelligence researcher, where he
      aggregates air quality data from over 50 countries, prompt engineers and
      feeds them into OpenAI APIs, to create short articles and infographics to
      promote awareness.
      <br /><br />
      When asked about their experience with applying for NOC, it seems that NOC
      Beijing is understanding towards students who have not had much experience
      with starting up, and focuses more on the attitude and level of interest
      towards it. For example, Joan mentioned that she mainly had experience
      with case competitions, and Shi Tong did not have a portfolio of projects
      and internships. Instead, their interests and personalities and ability to
      represent NUS and Singapore on the global stage was what got them into the
      program.
      <br /><br />
      As for their experiences here, they found that people in Beijing were very
      forthcoming when it comes to talking with students. Especially when they
      hear that you are a Singaporean student who made the brave step out
      overseas and are interested to learn about their culture, they are happy
      to share their thoughts and experiences with you. The program manager, Mr
      Jason Phoa, also had many connections in the Beijing scene, and introduced
      them to an angel investor and a CEO mentor/mentee of his to talk to the
      students. In addition to 奇迹创坛, Beijing has a platform called
      startupgrind, and PKU also had quite a few entrepreneurship clubs and
      events. However, it seems I have been misled about the Silicon Valley of
      China. The perception was that Beijing was an area which focuses more on
      governance, Shanghai on finance, and Shenzhen on tech innovation. But I am
      here in Beijing already so I can only make the most out of it.
      <br /><br />
      After I left the conversation, I realised that I did not have my passport
      which was a pretty frantic scare for me. I asked Han Min to help me check
      with the cafe, and luckily I left it there. I went over to the cafe to
      pick it up, before heading over to the hostel. It was tucked rather deep
      within a network of small alleys, which gave it a rather seedy feeling,
      but I went in and the place was rather clean and nicely put together. I
      took a walk around the building, and noticed that most of the people
      staying here were rather old which gave me another bad feeling. I bought a
      lock and locked my stuff up, before heading out to explore. It drizzled
      not before long, so I headed back to the hostel to pick up my clothes
      which were hanging outside. That was when I met Ali, and talked to him.
      <br /><br />
      Ali is a British Muslim man, here in Beijing for work. He has a pretty
      long history with Beijing, an understanding of the lay of the land, and
      finds that the Chinese are the happiest around the world. In addition to
      the lower cost of living, he finds that Beijing is a much better place to
      stay compared to the UK. He graduated with a Masters degree after studying
      User Experience and Media, and has had experience dealing with sourcing
      goods and selling them. I told him I was interested in business, and he
      skeptically asked what type of business, because life as a whole is just a
      business, for ourselves. What he said was true, but it always sucks to
      hear these things. I know I should be starting my own business if I was
      actually interested, but I am not interested in starting garbage
      businesses. Anyways, we talked a bit more and he said he had to go meet a
      friend for dinner. He asked me if I wanted to go, and I agreed, since it
      was my first night out in Beijing.
      <br /><br />
      We met his friend, a single mother called Angel, of a 7 year old with the
      nickname 米多. We had Northeastern cuisine for dinner, and I had the
      pleasure of playing with 米多, seeing him gradually open up from a shy boy
      hiding behind his mother, to a bouncing ball of energy, excitedly talking
      about Minecraft, killing Herobrine, digging up mountains and clearing
      forests of trees. He started leaning against me and squirming about me as
      we were eating, and Angel commented that he has always sat beside her when
      eating, and was never so glued to anyone else other than her. I wasn’t
      sure what to make of it, but a part of me felt sad for him because I
      attributed it to his family structure, but it also seemed to me like his
      mother cared for him very deeply. She said that he has friends at school
      and he is relatively independent, so she is not worried about him. But she
      is not demanding on him as well, and just wants him to be able to live a
      comfortable life next time.
      <br /><br />
      As we bade farewell to the small family, it was rather poignant, a
      semi-reflection of my experiences, of a kid who is unaware of the world
      around him and the implications of his situation. But those implications
      are just societal, and does not have any bearing on where he will end up
      in life. 米多 asked me to go over to his place and watch him play
      Minecraft, and he right before he left he asked if he could come out to
      play with us again tomorrow. I will never see this family ever again, but
      I hope that 米多 grows up to be a fine young man.
      <br /><br />
      Ali and I then headed out to 三里屯 to have a beer.
      <br /><br />
      When I made it back to the hostel, I finally met the mystery man staying
      on the bed above me. A young Vietnamese man called Hung, who actually came
      over to Singapore for an exchange with Yale NUS. He is currently studying
      Psychology at a university in Suzhou, and had a pretty good sense of
      humour.
      <br /><br />
      <a id="day-9">Day 9: 24 May</a>
      <br /><br />
      I woke up at 3 to watch the flag raising but I did a bunch of calculations
      in my head before cancelling my booking and going back to sleep. I woke up
      again and had breakfast with Hung, before taking a taxi over to Tsinghua.
      I was 15 minutes late to the meeting and I felt really bad, but 董睿 was
      kind and made nothing of it. He brought me around the campus and
      introduced the buildings to me, telling me exactly when the buildings were
      built and the history of those buildings. It was interesting to see that
      many of the buildings in there had architectural styles similar to the
      West. He explained that the Western influence came from the 1900s, when
      the Chinese set up Tsinghua to groom students to be able to trade with the
      Western countries. That was when Western architects came to design a few
      of the first buildings. In addition to these Western buildings, there were
      also some buildings that were Chinese styled. For example, the principal’s
      office is of an ancient Chinese architecture, and there was also evidence
      of more modern architecture such as the performing arts theatre which was
      built in 2011, the 100 year anniversary of Tsinghua. Generally, there was
      a variety of architectural styles in Tsinghua, which adds to the culture.
      <br /><br />
      During the school tour, 董睿 also mentioned many literary figures and
      their influences on the school, which made me wonder why the rich culture
      of arts led to a leading engineering school. He answered that there was a
      period in mid-1900s where the school had either sent arts students to
      other schools to study, or completely shut down the arts schools, leaving
      only the engineering schools behind. I could not really catch the reason
      behind the closures because his Mandarin was just too complex and fast. He
      then said that when the arts departments re-opened, there was a rapid
      recovery of the arts departments.
      <br /><br />
      It is slightly awe inducing to think that Tsinghua is only 8 years older
      than Hwa Chong, but it feels like there has been a lot of history, owing
      to its geography, politics and posture as a leading institution in the
      East.
      <br /><br />
      After the introduction to the school, 董睿 brought me to lunch at the
      cafeteria with his fellow PhD student 杨勇, who was slightly more
      proficient at English and used to be a party member. He studied economics
      in the past, and currently is studying linguistics and literature, hence
      his association with 董睿 and his language developmental research. We
      talked about my BMAT inspired app idea, which they found a ‘good idea’ (I
      doubt they actually do) and mentioned the ban on tuition centres leading
      to a rise in the online tuition industry. I no longer think much about
      that idea anyways. I then talked about the process of finding problems to
      solve as the creative source of a business idea, instead of thinking about
      profits first. They then mentioned that in the next 20 years, it is
      probably a safe bet to think about semiconductors and microchips,
      biotechnology and materials sciences. And if there is a pain point in a
      different yet more incumbent industry such as EdTech that you can solve,
      that would be a good idea as well. We concluded the conversation with some
      observations about Singapore and then they left to do their work, leaving
      me to explore the campus on my own.
      <br /><br />
      I walked maybe 2 rounds around the campus, clocking about 5000 steps,
      before it started raining. I wanted to get on a bike to leave the school
      as quickly as possible, but my mobile data decided against it for me. I
      walked up to a shelter, where two girls were standing, and asked them for
      directions to the nearest cafe. They asked me to look at my map to look
      for the nearest cafe, and I said that my mobile data did not allow me to.
      They asked me if I came from another country, and I said yes. So they
      asked if they wanted them to bring me there. Of course I said yes.
      <br /><br />
      One of the girls studied journalism, while the other studied economics and
      finance. The former was out to do street interviews, and the latter was
      the videographer. However due to the rain, they cancelled their
      videography. The economics student talked about her experience coming to
      Singapore for a week to visit a conglomerate here as part of an
      entrepreneurship course. I didn’t talk to them much because I was just
      being my own brand of awkward with females and just walking at the side. I
      reached the cafe and got an iced latte to wake myself up again, and when I
      was done it was raining outside again. I stood out there in the cold
      again, rethinking what I should be doing in the university. A gaggle of
      Caucasians then walked and cycled past the building. I debated in my head
      whether I should talk to them or not. I was in China, so of course I did.
      I ran after them, asked them if they were doing their Masters here, and
      learned that they were here for a semester long language program to learn
      Mandarin. It was interesting that people from the US came over to learn
      Mandarin given the tensions and the fact that some of them were not even
      interested in coming to China to work. I sensed a sort of hostility and
      awkwardness from the group, so I got an out by asking for the way to the
      exit, and I made my way there. I was ready to throw in the towel, when Yi
      Xuan replied to my message asking if he was available. He was only
      returning to school in 5 hours’ time, so I asked him for someone
      Singaporean I could talk to for that time being.
      <br /><br />
      Tian Lang is penultimate year economics student, studying purely economics
      instead of the usual economics and management that Tsinghua students read.
      He brought me to a cafe to have a seat, and I told him all the interesting
      stories that I have went through thus far, with himself sharing about his
      friend’s experience in Cornell, getting ‘kidnapped’ and ransomed, or
      sharing beds with other guys while exploring the Niagara Falls. Not long
      after, his economics students, two Hong Kongers, came to learn about
      misallocation of labour and something about frontier shifts. I listened to
      about half of the lesson, and found that he explained the topic rather
      well. After the lesson, he brought me on a mini-tour of the school,
      showing me the small lake again, talking about the statue by the lake and
      his poem on fatherly love, an aberration from the usual motherly love
      poems. Then he brought me to the science and math buildings to have a
      look.
      <br /><br />
      I asked him about the state of the Chinese economy and whether there
      really was a ticking budget deficit bomb in the government. He generally
      gave noncommittal economist answers but did say that the CPF equivalent
      for China was quite high, and may not have weighed so heavy on the
      government.
      <br /><br />
      When it came time for dinner, he brought me to the 五道口 area, one that
      the taxi driver said had many English speaking international students. We
      had dinner at a Hong Kong cafe, where we started to talk about our goals.
      I think the pair that I have met have a greater tendency towards their own
      motivations and as they say, ‘utility functions’. I asked Tian Lang if he
      may have thought it was a ‘wasted talent’ that he did not want to climb
      high and do something big, and he was visibly offended by that question,
      citing that he has been called that many times in his life. Tian Lang did
      not see value in much else other than ensuring his parents live a good
      life, Chinese chess and learning about economics. Yi Xuan, who once wanted
      to climb the corporate ladder, lost interest in the rat race after meeting
      his girlfriend and learning about her passion for public service. He also
      mentioned the toxicity of fellow students when it came to getting
      internships and academics, which he did not subscribe to. Hence, it is his
      goal to contribute to the greater good from a position of influence within
      existing corporations.
      <br /><br />
      I am not sure whether it was because I am tactless, but I somehow felt
      that that conversation was a net negative, because I felt like I had
      inadvertently insulted their goals. But I mean things like that do tend to
      be sensitive so I guess I kind of asked for it by mentioning it and by
      being surprised it wasn’t as high reaching as I thought.
      <br /><br />
      Yi Xuan then talked about us existing in a society which is sculpted by
      human constructs, and he did not see value in climbing these constructs
      built by our predecessors. Instead, he would rather do things on his own
      personal terms in order to achieve personal happiness. I didn’t agree with
      this mental model back then, neither do I now, but to a lesser extent. I
      think that there are as many constructs made for the betterment of
      society, as those that are worthless and just makes people go around in
      loops. I believe he also knows that as well, and would devote his time
      towards those that actually matter.
      <br /><br />
      The conversation did not really go far in terms of them sharing their
      experiences or anything like that because my mind sort of froze when it
      did not have the sense of kindredness and I think that was really bad for
      me. Anyways we left and I had a Chagee with Tian Lang and listened to him
      share more about economics and Marxism and things of that like.
      <br /><br />
      I took the 五道口 station back and it was definitely a mistake because I
      had to zigzag across lines instead of taking the direct eastward heading
      one. I ended up having to walk around 2km from 望京 to 望京南 and it was a
      rather late night and not welcome workout.
      <br /><br />
      <a id="day-10">Day 10: 25 May</a>
      <br /><br />
      I woke up slightly late and it was raining rather heavily, so I spent the
      most of the morning and afternoon sleeping, and on my computer. By 2pm, a
      Caucasian man entered the room and greeted me in mispronounced Mandarin
      and I spoke in English back to him. It turns out he was an Englishman from
      Milton-Keynes who studied architecture in the UK, and he had worked for 2
      years at an engineering consultancy firm to save up for a trip around
      Asia. He thought that the cultures in Asia were starkly different from
      those in the West, so he wanted to experience and capture them on camera.
      Apart from architecture and photography, he was a powerlifter as well,
      winning in a few local competitions. His name was Matthew.
      <br /><br />
      I had lunch with Matthew at a noodle store having beef fried rice and
      dumplings, before we headed back to the hostel and I took another nap. I
      woke up and asked if he wanted to check out 798 art district. He asked to
      follow and we went there, seeing a few art exhibitions. It turns out that
      the place used to be a military factory, which became apparent as we moved
      deeper into the complex, as the buildings became increasingly boxy with
      brick facades. There were a few massive rusted structures that were
      clearly used for production back during the war, together with overhead
      bridges and a train station. There wasn’t anything overly notable in the
      region, other than the big structures. The stores were average.
      <br /><br />
      After we were done, we went for dinner below the hostel, where he ordered
      some homemade noodles, and got a ChaPanda to drink in the hostel. Back
      there, I helped a group of French people with ordering their dinner of
      McDonalds, and I decided to order my dinner with them as well. I joined
      Menon, Nico, Robinson, and a few other French guys for their dinner,
      settling their missing order of 10 McNuggets. They were from Shanghai
      University, on exchange from engineering programs from 3 universities in
      France. Apparently, as white guys, they are able to enter nightclubs for
      free in Shanghai, and get free tables, drinks and everything else there. I
      asked if they wanted to join me to see nightlife, but apparently they had
      to wake up early tomorrow.
      <br /><br />
      I then brought Matthew into the 五道口 area, and walked into the first
      bar, Coffee & Bar. Matthew said that the drinks were too expensive, so I
      brought him slightly further down the road where I saw a 啤酒超市 which I
      translated as a beer supermarket and I assumed the drinks would be cheap
      there. And they were. We got ourselves a few beers and sat there for a
      bit, before a pair sat beside us. As an opener, I asked them if they were
      a couple. It turns out the girl was a nurse, and the man was a dentist,
      and they were introduced to each other through a friend.
      <br /><br />
      I spoke to the medical pair in Chinese while Matthew just sat there, so I
      felt little bad. So I went to the pair of girls behind Matthew and asked
      if they could speak English, because the white man found them pretty.
      Apparently they didn’t know how to speak English, but I think they are
      full of shit. After the failed first attempt, the dentist tried again for
      us, asking the girls if they wanted to sit with Matthew, but he came back
      claiming that those girls had boyfriends. Screw them, they did not look as
      good up close anyways.
      <br /><br />
      <a id="day-11">Day 11: 26 May</a>
      <br /><br />
      The dentist wanted to buy us a drink, as he said that he was happy to have
      us in his country, and that it was his duty to ensure we have a good time.
      He bought us a big can of apple whiskey cocktail, which tasted not too
      bad, and we drank. The nurse said that the dentist was going through
      something and therefore was out to drink together, but the nurse was going
      to leave because she had work the next day from 9am to 7pm. Matthew asked
      how many times a week she had a 10 hour shift, and she said for around 3
      to 4 days. He said that it was not too far apart from British nurses.
      <br /><br />
      I didn’t see the medical pair leave, because I was trying to get ourselves
      into another group. I took a walk around the bar, and saw a group of 5
      girls sitting at the table, so I asked them if they knew how to speak
      English. I pointed to Matthew and they were ecstatic to see a white man,
      so we joined their table. I kind of expected to just sit there and watch
      Matthew play with the girls so I zoned out on my phone at the side.
      <br /><br />
      The group thrust a card towards me and explained the rules of the game to
      me in Chinese, but I could not understand a single thing they were saying
      because my critical faculties were at an all time low. From what I
      understood it was a fizz-buzz game with the card you received and I just
      drank at every juncture because I just assumed I lost. That’s when while I
      was leaning on the table, a hand grabbed my face and hair. The girl
      opposite me was touching my hair for some reason and I just accepted and
      leaned into it. I just sat there all conked out and I think I fell asleep
      for a brief moment. She gave me a cigarette and lighted it for me and I
      gave it back to her after the first puff. She smoked it for a bit more and
      gave it back to me. I took an even deeper puff of the cigarette this time.
      The filter was moist with her saliva. I exhaled and coughed hard. I don’t
      know why I remembered so much of this interaction.
      <br /><br />
      I then asked if I could sit beside her and she signalled for me to go
      over. I sat there and just leaned on her more while she just continued
      ruffling my hair and shit like that. I felt queasy all of a sudden and I
      felt my mouth watering a lot. Somehow I remembered this was a Reddit LPT
      that it is a sign that you are about to vomit, so I held the bucket of ice
      under my mouth as I prepared to vomit. She held the cup for me while I
      vomited and I could taste the apple whiskey cocktail. All the while she
      was holding my head for some reason. Not going to lie but I enjoyed the
      touch of a woman after such a long period of ‘deprivation’. I just leaned
      on her until they decided to leave, and she grabbed my hand and pulled me
      out to the club next door. I don’t remember what was going on, but I could
      remember them negotiating to go in for free and they managed to get in.
      She pulled me onto the stage and started dancing and I just fell into the
      music as well. I didn’t enjoy the music but I did it for her sake. She put
      my hands around her stomach and she grabbed under my shirt and held onto
      my stomach as well. I could feel her warm hands touching my stomach. I
      remember a guy coming up to me and giving me a beer and the girl pushed it
      away from me, drinking it herself instead. He called me a pussy and told
      me to protect her. Looking back at that moment, neither of us probably
      should have drank that beer because they could 100% be roofied and shit.
      But after each time she drank the beer she would just turn around and
      smooch me and I could feel the cold beer on her tongue and a slight
      sulphurous smell. I also remember that while she put my hands on her
      stomach, she turned around and kissed her female friend, put her hands
      into someone else’s shirt and probably some other weird shit. I think she
      asked me if she could kiss another guy and I probably said no. I don’t
      remember this part well. And while she was doing all that I remember my
      mind was screaming ‘disengage’ and I slowly backed away from her and took
      my hands off her. She pulled them back promptly. She tried to give me
      hickies as well. They hurt, but luckily none of them left a mark.
      <br /><br />
      Her name is Lilith and she is studying Economics at PKU (I later found out
      she was not from PKU). I’m not so sure about her friends but that is what
      I remember. I don’t know in which part of history China became so wild
      either but this whole incident has stayed at the front of my mind for the
      coming two days and I am rather conflicted of the whole incident. While I
      may slightly gag every time I think about her tongue intermingling with
      mine, or smelling something which reminds me of the sulphurous smell, a
      small part of me relished the incident as well. And this is why I recorded
      down what I remembered of the incident, otherwise I would have let this
      fade away in the annals of my mind.
      <br /><br />
      When they decided it was time to leave, the two friends were wondering
      where Matthew and his partner left to. I remember seeing them making out
      on the dance floor but that was all. They probably went to smash in the
      toilet. Lilith kept flirting with me outside the club and I was just
      deflecting everything that came my way. She pulled my arm and both of us
      fell into the dirt behind her, and there was dirt on my hands. I took her
      hands and wiped them on my shirt. I think a girl like her is rather rare
      but that is probably not a good thing either.
      <br /><br />
      The group wanted to eat breakfast, so they left for some dim sum place
      round the corner. I felt really awkward with the group of people because I
      kept shading them for being the life of the party, and there was a rather
      pretty girl sitting beside Matthew who was wondering what nationality
      Matthew was. So I answered her directly, and I ended up engaging with them
      for the rest of the breakfast instead. The guy beside me, 胡成宇, dressed
      up and looked rather like A-Xin from Mayday, and they just came for the
      Mayday concert, so I started singing Mayday songs to them. Then Jay Chou
      songs. Then JJ Lin songs, Mao Buyi, Joker Xue, Fei Yu-Ching, Wanting, and
      that was when we caught the attention of the adjacent table. There was a
      Shanghainese man, just like 成宇, and so he came over to say hello to him.
      And that was when we started to sing Jay Chou songs together. That was
      when they said he was Taiwanese, and asked me if Taiwan was part of China.
      I didn’t know any better, so I asked, “Isn’t that a sensitive matter?”
      <br /><br />
      Outrage ensued. They were questioning whether the pair beside me were
      actually Chinese, and whether I am a Chinese person. Eventually I caved
      and said yes, and that was when the tension felt like it was boiling over.
      I asked A-Xin where the toilet was, and he offered to bring me to the
      toilet. I learnt that he was a Product Manager who dealt with something on
      the statistics of gaming live-streams, and was subcontracted by Tencent.
      He was actively consoling me that it was not my fault that that incident
      had happened after I said I was an embarrassment to Singapore. It was
      rather comforting to have him to talk to as we looked for the toilet.
      <br /><br />
      When we got back, the lady kept cussing out the rowdy group for
      questioning her nationality. The big guy from the rowdy table came over to
      apologise profusely for their actions and apologised to me as well. I said
      it was okay and we left. The pair called a cab for themselves, and we
      split up from there.
      <br /><br />
      I had to meet Yi Xuan, Tian Lang, and his Malaysian roommate in 6 hours’
      time. What do I do then?
      <br /><br />
      I thought about it, and I decided I need some sleep. Head pounding, I got
      on a bike and cycled back to the purple line. I wasn’t going to make the
      same mistake as I did last time. I slept at the hostel for 1.5 hours
      before packing up silently so as not to wake Matthew, and swiftly checked
      out. It took me another hour to reach BHG Mall, where I met the trio at
      绿茶餐厅, where they ordered a boatload of food.
      <br /><br />
      The Malaysian roommate’s name was William, and his appearance reminded me
      of the other Malaysian guy in my BMT whose name I can’t remember off the
      top of my head. I got to telling my story of Ali and they seemed to enjoy
      the story. I told William about Shi Tong, who said that he was not taught
      and therefore did not know anything about entrepreneurship before he got
      to Singapore. William seemed confused that someone could have not heard
      about entrepreneurship, so I did not beg that question. Instead I asked
      more about him. He used to be from Johor Bahru, and he was studying pure
      Economics as well. He said he was very stupid and very lazy and had poor
      time management, which in part resulted in him getting rejected from SEM
      and being in the middle of the cohort. He called Tian Lang a waste of
      talent as well, which shocked me about how cavalier he was with
      denigrating others. I got to understand that his interest lies in motor
      sports, and he was the founder and president of Tsinghua Motor Sports
      interest group, and that he was selling printed clothes in order to raise
      capital for his future venture which would lie closer to motor sports. His
      end goal was to effect positive change through a fund of his own. He said
      that there was untapped demand for motorsports apparel because there
      wasn’t any shops that sold motorsports related apparel. I asked him how he
      knew there was demand in the first place. He said that motorsports is
      gaining popularity around the world, and that I, me, Ravan Chan, have not
      heard about any shops that sold such goods. I internally balked at that
      assertion. I have zero interest in motorsports so why do you expect me to
      know where to look for these clothes. He wanted to sell to people who had
      mild interest in these goods as well.
      <br /><br />
      I recommended to him to use a waitlist of sorts to ascertain market demand
      for these goods before he puts them into production, which many who are
      interested in the apparel business do utilise. He seems to oppose that
      idea, saying that the marketing required to make these waitlists are not
      worth the cost, so he would rather put his goods in the market directly
      instead. I found it rather odd that he would not spend on marketing of the
      waitlist but would put in money to purchase stock immediately without
      knowing his stock would be bought. Marketing for the waitlist was
      essentially equivalent to marketing for the product, minus the cost of
      producing the inventory.
      <br /><br />
      I also mentioned that I wanted to do SaaS business, due to its relatively
      lower start up and operational costs at a lower level. William rebutted
      that point as well, citing his experience as a “Financial Advisor” i.e. a
      deal sourcing for a VC firm, and him noticing that operating costs for
      relatively larger B2B SaaS products are large. But I feel that that
      occurred at an enterprise level, and that small, tiny firms that just
      started out do not face that issue. I did not want to rebut him on the
      spot because it felt like I was beholden to him, being the one who asked
      him for lunch. But it felt like William had the propensity to want to
      oppose everything that I said.
      <br /><br />
      When telling him about the books and literature that I have read, Tian
      Lang and William both rejected that idea of reading a lot, citing its
      better to do than to read. I explained that it is not feasible to start
      without a good problem and pain point I am facing, and just to postulate
      there is a demand out there and start doing a business. They then said
      that reading books alone was not going to help either, just because you
      read it does not mean that you will start a good business. Tian Lang then
      talked about the Efficient Markets Hypothesis, saying that any shortfall
      in the market would be instantaneously patched up by the big incumbents.
      But this is opposed to what Siu Ray mentions, which is that incumbents
      would often not be agile enough to come up with solutions to small
      problems. I did not mention any of it to them because I was not in an
      argumentative mood or position. I guess that really puts me as someone
      with no backbone. But the conclusion was that I need to be on the look out
      more for pain points and itch points to address, a piece of advice I have
      already heard from Paul Graham. I think this group should be proud of
      coming to the same conclusion as PG, but honestly their pessimism brought
      me down quite a bit.
      <br /><br />
      When it came time to leave, I tried hitting up Lilith to find some way to
      spend my time not alone between then and my train back to ZhuoZhou. She
      played hard to get before I got jilted at the outside of the PKU gate, and
      I just went to the train station to sleep.
      <br /><br />
      I slept for an hour on the seats before boarding, and fell asleep again in
      the train. I set a timer for 15 minutes, and I woke up to see an
      unfamiliar backdrop. I saw the banner say 保定东 and I was thinking to
      myself “This isn’t the same as ZhuoZhouDong is it?” I asked the train
      attendant what the difference was and she angrily replied there’s a 1
      station difference. My heart sank a bit and I thought I was going to have
      to spend the night at another random ass place. Luckily the train station
      attendants were all really nice and let me take a train heading back
      towards Beijing East to drop me off at ZhuoZhou.
      <br /><br />
      I went back to the house feeling extra depressed and extra disillusioned
      with this whole trip, giving a call to Yee Rei to vent and went to sleep
      afterwards.
      <br /><br />
      <a id="day-12">Day 12: 27 May</a>
      <br /><br />
      I did not do much today. I caught up on my lost sleep by waking up at 9 or
      10am, and essentially wrote for the whole time, catching up on the backlog
      of days that I have not recorded. I that that will be my last day staying
      at Bowen’s dad’s place, which was doubled down by the incident that
      happened yesterday. Other than typing, I spent my time packing my stuff
      up, (trying to) clean up the place, and going down to eat some lunch.
      <br /><br />
      I had lunch at some random noodle house that I saw people were eating in,
      and decided to go in as well. I took a safe bet on beef noodles, but the
      chef cooked egg noodles for me instead. It was a massive plate of noodles,
      and I could barely finish a third of it. The owner seemed pretty
      disappointed since she told the chef to cook more as a young boy was going
      to eat it.
      <br /><br />
      I wrote a thank you note to Bowen’s dad before leaving the place, as well
      as an apple, an orange, and a bunch of grapes that I think I was
      overcharged for but I guess I am injecting some Singaporean cash into the
      ZhuoZhou economy. Doing some good, yeah.
      <br /><br />
      I took a cab with an ultra safe Didi driver, got frustrated at the train
      station employee, and thus was on my merry way to Beijing, where I was
      meeting Han Min at his place.
      <br /><br />
      I arrived at TongZhou, and when I got out of the train station, I was
      amazed by the projections of water refractions, and the grandeur of the
      buildings there. I couldn’t believe that Han Min stayed in such a
      beautiful building, but it turns out he did. I got up to his place, put
      down my stuff, and had dinner with him at Papa John’s. It was pathetic.
      The large pizza was no larger than a medium in Singapore, and the sides
      were enough to feed one person. All that for 128 yuan.
      <br /><br />
      I asked him what he did in the army, and found out that he cleaned tanks
      and was the rear guide for his company. He was from 40SAR when LTC Alvin
      Chan was still the CO, and had even added him on Facebook. He ended up as
      a rear guide because he did not want to serve the extra few years of
      possible call-ups in the future, and heard that the troopers had it good
      during reservist. After making that decision, he went to the MO and said
      that he was allergic to grass. We talked a bit more about what Han Min had
      been doing for the past weekend when he had visited Shanghai. It was a
      day-trip for him to meet with another crypto bro, and he took a 9 hour
      long train back to Beijing, cramped and stuck with crying children. We
      then continued talking about crypto, and I told him that I simply could
      not buy crypto because I did not understand what went on with crypto,
      describing myself as a ‘fundamentalist’. He said that he did not
      understand too well either, but as long as he was making money, he was
      fine with it. He also introduced me to a couple of other sources where I
      could pick up on my blockchain nous, namely HackerNoon, Stanford
      Blockchain Review, and also showed me this guy called Kent Lin, who is the
      president of Harvard Blockchain. I also opined that it is hard for
      blockchain to take off because of the irreversibility of transactions
      on-chain, and that people are way too stupid for us to have an absolutely
      irreversible transaction. He agreed and said that he has received coins
      out of nowhere before, probably because someone has mis-typed the
      blockchain address, but thought that there has to be more policies put in
      place before it can be widespread. I thought that contradictory of the
      principle of decentralisation, but you gotta do what you gotta do. He
      thinks that Web3 will take over all of the internet, from the Web2.5 that
      we are currently in, and hence therein lies a massive opportunity. I don’t
      really know what an internet fully taken over by Web3 will look like. But
      if that is the case there is a strong need for myself to really understand
      what Web3 entails.
      <br /><br />
      After we were finished, we had a beer next door, and then I had the worst
      diarhoerra experience in my life. Because of that, I did not dare to go
      out afterwards and just retired for the night.
      <br /><br />
      <a id="day-13">Day 13: 28 May</a>
      <br /><br />
      I tried to wake up at 6am to get an early start on the day since I had not
      been very ‘productive’ the day before. I also realised that my 天坛
      booking was for today, so I snuck in a couple more minutes of sleep before
      I got up and out to start the day. I couldn’t find my wallet anywhere but
      was rather confident that it was in the apartment, so I just left.
      <br /><br />
      I bought a luckin coffee and brought it down into the train, not drinking
      it because it was too cramped on the train to drink something and I was
      low key afraid of a stomachache. And I guess my bets were correct. After
      walking midway through the passageway in the garden, my stomach started to
      cramp and I ran for the nearest bathroom, careful not to make the same
      mistakes as I did yesterday. Luckily, the diarhoerra was much milder today
      and everything went under control. I walked around the central and east of
      the garden assiduously and took photos of whatever I could, taking photos
      for a Spanish couple just for the guy to garble the photo for me. I asked
      some lady with a massive camera to take the photo for me instead, thinking
      she knew how to use one but apparently she did not either.
      <br /><br />
      Upon Joan’s recommendation, I headed to 大鼓胡同 to take a look at what it
      was about, and it was a street lined with many Chinese specialty items and
      therefore appeared to me rather like a tourist trap. It was a really hot
      day and I walked a considerable amount, so I went to get a cold Chagee
      before I continued walking, stumbling upon two big and old looking
      buildings. I bought a ticket into the drum tower and got a bout of
      diarhoerra.
      <br /><br />
      The reason why I am writing all of these superfluous detail is because it
      was this sequence of events and timings which resulted in me bumping into
      another Singaporean family, a family of 4 consisting of 2 sons, a daughter
      and their mother, climbing the stairs up the tower. When we reached the
      top of the tower, I said hello, and found out that the children in the
      family were all around my age, and had told them that I was travelling
      alone since May 16. The family had also been travelling around China since
      May 13, with their first stop being Hainan. Chatting a bit further, the
      oldest of the group, who I found out was called Wesley, asked for my
      Instagram. I said it was rather private so I asked for his LinkedIn
      instead. During the drum performance, which was surprisingly
      underwhelming, I looked through Wesley’s profile and found out that he had
      co-founded his own business, as well as done private equity related
      internships. I told him I was quite interested in what he had done so far,
      but tried to engage the rest of the family a bit more.
      <br /><br />
      The daughter was a first year SMU Infosys student, while the younger son
      Warren was a first year NUS Engineering student. The daughter had claimed
      that she had done most of the arrangements during the trip with WeChat,
      and seemed rather extroverted. She was excited by the fact that I had been
      on a solo trip, nudging her mother to let her go on one as well. Warren on
      the other hand, was extremely quiet and introverted. It somewhat seemed
      that a part of him did not want to be there, so I did not disturb him
      after asking him a question.
      <br /><br />
      I took a few photos for the family, before buying a ticket and moving over
      to the opposite building, where I helped them take photos once again. I
      then started talking to Wesley about school, first asking why he chose to
      go to Montreal for SEP instead of NOC for entrepreneurship. He mentioned
      that he would not do entrepreneurship immediately full time, and would
      prefer to do a corporate job first before going into entrepreneurship. He
      told me he was eyeing a company called EDP Renewables, has attended an
      outreach event by them, and was going for an interview with them soon. I
      discussed with him about his past jobs at the investment firms, and learnt
      that he was likely going to be an M&A Analyst at his new company. On the
      other hand, Birdlabs, was a side project where his friend needed a sales
      co-founder. He took up the mantle, helping with cold outreach through
      calling, emails and even knocking on doors in the industrial areas like
      Tuas and Woodlands, where his main clientele of construction and
      manufacturing companies are located. He said that most companies in the
      industry still rely on paperwork, and know that they are due for change,
      and most of them go to Accenture for tech consulting. Hence, they decided
      to start their own lower cost competition . I was told that business was
      doing well, with 1 active customer and over 5 more in the pipeline.
      <br /><br />
      I was curious why he did not do some of the coding as well, since he had
      done business analytics and finance in his time. The coding he had dealt
      with was rudimentary, so he claimed. I also asked if those were the two
      most rigorous specialisations to take, which he confirmed, so it was quite
      impressive he could score first class honours with all that he is doing.
      He also mentioned that he had dabbled in Web3 before, building liquidity
      pools or something of that like. He mentioned that his CS friend had found
      an open source liquidity pool code online, and had forked it and changed
      the UI to make it work. He had spent his whole holidays building liquidity
      pools, which ended up earning him 700k USD in the span of one summer. I
      thought that was really impressive. Wesley on the other hand was bound by
      full time internship commitments and was not as able to build these pools.
      We then talked about residential options, to which he introduced me to
      N-House, which is a program which allows NOC Students, Alums and Friends
      of NOC to stay in specially segregated rooms in Kent Ridge and Sheares
      Hall. He also said that he had friends who left hall midway through their
      first semester there, because he did not like the bunch there.
      <br /><br />
      The family bought me a mango drink which tasted like cough syrup, so I
      obliged and drank half of it before entering the station. I taught the
      whole lot how to set up their Alipay for transport, and got them in
      without having to purchase a ticket from the machines. I bade farewell to
      them and travelled in opposite directions, because I had to head northwest
      for 中关村. But I did not go there straight, because I had about 2-3 hours
      before work hours ended. So I went to Olympic Park.
      <br /><br />
      When I exited the station, I was greeted by a mall. This reminded me of
      Kallang Wave Mall. I left the mall and walked all the way to the 鸟巢
      first, taking some pictures there and buying some merchandise to bring
      home. Afterwards, I took a bike 2 stations down towards the Forest Garden,
      taking a brochure and a couple of pictures there before I left.
      <br /><br />
      I took the train down to 五道口 station, took a walk to the building with
      奇绩创坛 (for the sake of simplicity we shall call it MiraclePlus from now
      on). I walked in, made weird eye contact with the security guard outside,
      and waltzed into the building. That was the first step down. I saw they
      were on the 6th floor, so I walked to the lifts, just to find gantries
      blocking access. Damn. I needed to regroup. Luckily, there was a cafe next
      door. I bought an americano and sat down, hoping to secure a proper way up
      by sending an email and hopefully getting an appointment just like that. I
      was also wondering what I could even talk to them about. I already asked
      most of my questions to Mr Sean Xin who answered them sufficiently for me
      to conclude that there is no point asking questions. So what was left was
      to try talking to founders. But at this time of the year, founders would
      not really be working in their office, so I was at a loss. I stalked their
      WeChat slightly more, finding out that they had a Campus Scout program,
      and was looking for interns as well. A different search on LinkedIn
      yielded a result where their company was hiring a remote founder in
      Singapore. Bingo I guess, they have a demand for Singapore, so I guess I
      shall be the bridge then.
      <br /><br />
      I waited 15 minutes for a reply from them. I was already done with my
      coffee, and was sitting on the sofa at the main lobby, thinking of the
      contingency plan. I was tight for time anyways, as I had to meet 董睿 for
      dinner soon. I thought of asking everyone who left whether they were from
      MiraclePlus, and whether they could get me into the office. But I felt the
      chance was a bit too low, and wanted to walk out of the building through a
      back door or so, so as not to arouse suspicion from the security guard. I
      walked to the side door of the cafe where I thought there would be an
      exit, and found myself staring at a staircase entrance. The decision
      making process felt as fast as it was slow. I did not have much time to
      think but I had to consider whether trespassing would get me in trouble or
      not.
      <br /><br />
      I walked past a Chinese guy at about level three. Once again a fast and
      slow decision.
      <br /><br />
      “你好，你是从奇绩的吗？”
      <br /><br />
      “是的。”
      <br /><br />
      Bingo. It was the right choice to have asked. I continued speaking to him
      in English, and learned that he had studied in Canada and therefore had a
      pretty good command of English. I introduced myself as being from
      Singapore, awaiting uni, interested in internships or the campus scout
      program, and would like to talk to someone. He told me he was an intern at
      MiraclePlus, but he would try his best to find someone for myself to talk
      to, and asked if I was going to be available for the coming days. I told
      him I was going to be gone soon, so time was of the essence. I had a visit
      to 故宫 soon but I am willing to forgo it to talk to that someone. He
      understood, we exchanged WeChat, and Ruicheng continued where he was
      originally going, and I asked if I could go all the way up. “Yeah, sure,
      why not?”
      <br /><br />
      The ceiling was surprisingly low on the top floor, and the office
      surprisingly quaint. There were a bunch of groups of people at the front
      office alone, and they all looked highly engaged in whatever they were
      doing. I walked in, looking confused, stood around for about half a
      minute, before walking out to re-group myself. That was when someone asked
      me if I was looking for somebody. It was an older man, about late 30s, and
      I told him I did not have an appointment with anyone, but I was looking
      for someone to talk to. I was halfway through introducing myself and my
      story in English, babbling nervously when Ruicheng walked by us again. I
      waved to him, and the older guy noticed that we knew each other. He
      chastised Ruicheng for not bringing me up to the office and letting me
      wander in alone, before handing me back to him again.
      <br /><br />
      Ruicheng texted the head of the Campus Scout program for me, and in about
      3 minutes, he came over. During the wait, I learnt that Ruicheng was a
      bio-tech or bio-chemistry graduate, I don’t particularly remember, but he
      studied both bachelors and masters in Canada. He said that Canada had
      terrible weather, but was the forefront of such research.
      <br /><br />
      The head of the Campus Scout program came over whilst he was still in a
      call. He had a pretty fair complexion and was slightly chubby, and I
      noticed that his fingers were short and stumpy. His hair was rather short
      and evenly grown, like he had shaven about 2 months ago and his hair had
      grown out without getting a trim. He spoke perfect English as well,
      hailing from University of Edinburgh, which I learnt was in Scotland,
      after mistakenly asking if it was in the UK or Ireland. He briefly
      introduced the Campus Scout program, first disclaiming that it may not be
      as good as it seems, for a number of reasons. Firstly, he said that Campus
      Scouts do not get a title like an intern, as interns had to be located on
      site. Secondly, the situation with MiraclePlus is not currently ideal, and
      they were trying to lay low, due to a controversy which happened near the
      start of this year where a portfolio company in the US had its CTO steal
      information from Google, which led to his arrest by the FBI. Thirdly, he
      mentioned that the organisational structure within the company was messy,
      and lastly he mentioned that as the government is a big investor in
      MiraclePlus, their investments had to be strategically aligned to the
      government interests in order to maintain funding. I asked if they were
      looking for Singaporean founders, based off of their recent LinkedIn job
      postings for Singaporean founders, to which he repeated the second point.
      <br /><br />
      Apart from that, he said that the goals of the Scout Program were to
      firstly, look for promising tech investments around the world, and
      secondarily, to expand the network of Chinese founders globally. He then
      talked about the resources that they are able to provide to the campus
      scouts, but they were limited outside of Mainland China due to the funding
      for the program being restricted for use in China. He also mentioned that
      there were other Campus Scouts for MiraclePlus in the US Bay Area, but not
      in Singapore. He said that NUS was a great university for tech, and
      therefore could see value in expanding the program to Singapore, but once
      again disclaimed that it may not be as good as I thought it would be. He
      then talked a bit about his own experiences in Singapore, where he went
      over with a CVC (Corporate VC) firm called Wuxi or something of that likes
      to look for investments in the biotech industry. I considered starting to
      chat about the Philip Yeo A*Star thing but decided not to since I do not
      have up to date information about it and would rather not look like a
      nonce. I concluded the conversation by exchanging WeChat with him, and
      telling him I would send him a proposal very soon. I went up to the
      rooftop and took a picture just to commemorate this moment. I was
      ecstatic.
      <br /><br />
      I left the building the same way I came - in case I got stuck at the
      gantries of the lifts. I couldn’t contain my excitement and just called
      Yee Rei to tell him about what audacious stunt I just pulled, and that it
      actually worked. I also go this to note down some points of the
      conversation in case I couldn’t remember it later. I then walked back to
      五道口, to look for 董睿. We had Beijing 炸酱面 at a relatively famous
      store, and it tasted really pretty good. I managed to pay for the meal as
      well because he did not know the carts synchronised across phones. In
      return, he bought us orange sodas, and he said that that was the hallmark
      of a Beijing meal, as the orange soda originated from Beijing as well. I
      told him about the stunt I just pulled, and he was pleasantly surprised,
      surmising that VC firms like these would entertain radicals like myself
      who are willing to waltz into their office and pitch myself to them. I
      asked him about how he manages his time as a doctoral student and an
      intern, and he just said he does his research at night, not before playing
      some games and watching some shows beforehand. He played Chinese Mobile
      Legends. I mentioned that I stayed in ZhuoZhou for a bit, and he mentioned
      that he had just visited ZhuoZhou with Innoven Capital because they had
      recently invested in a private hospital there. I asked him if he thought
      it was a shithole there. He simply said transport is cheap because he
      visited for an evening. I also asked whether he preferred Shanghai or
      Beijing, echoing the thoughts of the traveller I met in Mijia that people
      here are more impatient. 董睿 thought conversely, because he thought in
      Shanghai, people dealing with finance, are more precise and thus
      aggressive, whereas those in Beijing are more relaxed and thus more
      patient. We parted ways after that short conversation, and texted Lilith.
      <br /><br />
      The night before, I asked her out for the third time looking for some
      closure on the issue because it felt like we parted ways on a bad note.
      She finally agreed and suggested to eat at an Italian restaurant. I was
      suspicious that she wanted to rip me off for a meal at somewhere
      expensive, but I relented and agreed to have Italian food. When I sat
      outside a mall which I had thought was the correct meeting place, she told
      me that she did not want to eat and asked me to head somewhere else. At
      this point, alarm bells were ringing in my head. I contemplated about
      whether I should go, and how I should go there, eventually deciding to
      take the bike there. The subway station which I arrived at was not
      surrounded by much. It was just a few stores, and I saw a drunk man
      getting escorted away by two young shop attendants, and saw another man
      shattering a glass bottle on the ground across the street. None of those
      seemed like good omens to me, and I decided to just sit outside a police
      station in case I do get nabbed by someone.
      <br /><br />
      Well since you are reading this I clearly did not get nabbed. We walked
      around the neighbourhood, and she told me not to trust the girls there and
      she had taught me a lesson for being so trusting. She said I looked tense
      and I told her I just liked to walk like 诸葛亮 because I am a thinker. We
      continued walking and talking before she revealed to me that she was from
      a state sponsored or government school of international relations or
      something, and insisted that she was a nerd and that her GPA was 3.7. I
      don’t see much use in listing out every detail of the conversation we had,
      but I just showed her some pictures that I took while observing that the
      toilets in Beijing do not have managers. I showed her a bit more photos of
      THU and PKU, and she just said they looked nice without even getting to
      see much of the picture. She flirted with me a few more times, tried to
      hold hands with me and tried to pull me into a kiss while no one was
      looking. I rejected all of her advances not because I did not like her or
      anything but maybe more of the fact that I was nervous. Big regrets.
      <br /><br />
      We rushed to the subway station after taking a look at the cab prices
      (which I miscalculated) and I bade her farewell. I stopped two stations
      before the 通州北关 station and was forced to cycle back. It was a rather
      eventful day.
      <br /><br />
      <a id="day-14">Day 14: 29 May</a>
      <br /><br />
      I bought Han Min an americano from luckin coffee and an orange juice
      americano for myself. He was awake and doing work before I fully woke up
      for the day. The orange juice americano tasted surprisingly good, before
      and after mixing. I also had some work to get done, owing to the proposal
      I promised Sanchuan yesterday. I toggled between writing the journal and
      the proposal, and had a pretty hard time writing out the proposal,
      honestly. But I still squeezed something out, with a hopefully sufficient
      and convincing conclusion, sent it to Sanchuan, and got ready to head over
      to 故宫. This was a booking that I had made five days ago, so I had better
      show up for it.
      <br /><br />
      I took the train down to Tiananmen station, before being forced to walk
      like 4000 or 5000 steps around the garden because people were no longer
      allowed to skirt around the entrance to Tiananmen Square. And to be
      honest, I was rather annoyed by the first part of the experience. Perhaps
      it was the sweltering heat, or my hunger, but by the time I reached the
      third layer of the Forbidden City, it could be simplified as such. Layers
      and layers of big buildings with chairs in the middle. The exteriors were
      the same - a sundial, a statue of a deer, and a lion turtle. The lack of
      variation had me questioning what for I was walking so much for and
      snapping so many photos of, especially when I had visited 天坛公园 the day
      before, and snapped photos of the same thing at the fasting and abstinence
      temples. At some point I just decided to walk in the shade and took a turn
      out of the main compounds of the palaces, and found myself at what seems
      to be royal quarters. I took a peek in the room, overheard the explanation
      about long and narrow beds implying longevity, and then continued walking.
      I then went to the palace garden, snapped another few more photos, and
      then it seemed I had reached the end. This angered me further. I waited 5
      days in Beijing just to look at what insanity in the form of buildings
      looked like, looked at a room and looked at a garden. I was not standing
      for that so I took a right and decided to look for the palace museum which
      the signboard mentioned. I walked for what seemed like a third of the
      length of the Forbidden City, just to see that the museum needed tickets.
      I looked around more, and found an exhibition on optical instruments. You
      also need tickets for that. I looked around more, and found a palace of
      wisdom or something like that. You need a booking. Hot damn. I took a
      winding garden route out of the Forbidden City, and just told my mom that
      if she were to come she had better get a tour guide. At least you would
      feel slightly mode edified after wasting your time like this. To be
      honest, I don’t even know how many of those structures were as ancient as
      advertised. It seemed that it was just as easy to build something with the
      same style as the surrounding buildings, and ascribe a history to it.
      <br /><br />
      I was questioning the reality of everything. Why was this handrail on the
      stairs rough, and the adjacent handrail smooth? Was there meant to be a
      furnace that was filled up with concrete? Otherwise what was the purpose
      of those arches? Was the paint on the walls of the Forbidden City the same
      red paint that the people had looked at centuries ago? What about the
      concrete? Where was the line that preservation cross over to
      artificiality? I could not answer any of this. I just wanted food and air
      conditioning.
      <br /><br />
      I looked for the closest place that sold 蛋炒饭 and walked there. It was
      within a rather large mall and it took me quite some time to find the
      store. I was the only one eating there at 3pm, and they gave me a massive
      portion for 28 yuan. I ate as best as I could, and left feeling bloated as
      usual. I walked over to Tiananmen and sat down on the side of the pavement
      I thought I could sit there for an hour until I could enter, but I fell
      asleep and almost fell over, waking myself up alone the way. And a few
      moments after I had fallen over, the sound of artillery fire could be
      heard. I stood up and started taking a video, and noticed that the streets
      around me were all blockaded and empty. During the gunfire, I asked a
      local what special day it is today, and he could not find out. I thought
      it was the day of the protests 35 years ago, so I searched Google and that
      day was Jun 4th. So none of us knew why that happened, but I guessed that
      it was something official.
      <br /><br />
      After the roads had started, I decided I was done watching and turned back
      to buy a drink for myself, heading to 东方新天地 to get myself a Chagee.
      That was where I bumped into Tian Lang once again, surprising myself to
      have met him in such a big city. He said that his accounting class had
      just ended, and that he was there to visit KPMG offices. I saw that he had
      some KPMG merchandise as well. He asked me to try getting the 85%
      discount, which I could not because I did not have a Chinese number, so he
      bought a drink for me. I walked him to the station and we parted ways
      there, with the usual farewell of ‘see you in Singapore’.
      <br /><br />
      I walked back to Tiananmen Square, helping an English couple translate
      with the military policeman along the way, then headed into the square.
      Security seemed especially tight for me that day even as a Singaporean
      passport holder, with the security searching my whole bag, confiscating my
      poker cards, and finding my portable bidet. I had no idea how to explain
      it away so I just said it was for hygiene.
      <br /><br />
      The wind was especially big that day. I could feel the wind pushing me as
      I walked, the flags flapping in the winds standing almost horizontally.
      The sounds that the ten red flags in front of the memorial made felt
      really eerie to me, and at a date so close to the anniversary of the
      riots, a part of me felt a sort of sadness for the place because their
      bravery in uprising was actively silenced online. I looked across the road
      and saw the giant portrait of Mao, and the hundreds of Chinese people
      standing in front of the flag, taking pictures and waving the Chinese
      flag. For a moment it felt like he was watching his subjects, and they
      worshipped him almost like a god. I was shooed away from the left side of
      the square by plainclothes policemen and the young men clad in white,
      signalling that there was really something going on within the parliament
      hall, and in a few minutes time you could see men in business attire start
      leaving through the front door. I could only imagine how it would be like
      to leave after hours of discussion, being greeted by the big monument and
      hundreds of people looking at you, feeling the wind blow against you as
      you climb down the massive flight of stairs back to the ground floor.
      <br /><br />
      Maybe because it was the last day I was spending in Beijing, which made me
      so contemplative and rather emotional, or it may have been the fact that I
      had fumbled Lilith. I took a video of the flag lowering, posted it onto
      Instagram, and made my way back to Tongzhou. I reached at about 9pm, went
      for a short run, and faced massive trouble and embarrassment while trying
      to order at KFC. Somehow it felt like I could not get anything right that
      day. So I just laid down on the bench before deciding there’s no point in
      wallowing, got up, and went back to eat, shower and settle some of the
      hackathon and work administration. I wrote for a bit before succumbing to
      the z-monster.
      <br /><br />
      Han Min brought his girlfriend Stephanie back to his place and it seemed
      like she was pretty scared of me. Whatever. I am gone tomorrow anyways.
      <br /><br />
      <a id="day-15">Day 15: 30 May</a>
      <br /><br />
      I got up at 5, to the sun beaming on me. I packed up my clothes and did
      whatever I could silently before deciding it was too difficult to pack up
      without waking them up. I woke up at 7 again, going downstairs to get the
      three of us some coffee, and started packing up more comprehensively. I
      read a bit more in depth about the crypto papers, and went to town with
      packing at about 8. Surprisingly, I could pack up without waking them up
      at all. Han Min woke up at 9 to head for work, and I left the house
      together with him. He seemed really grateful for the coffee, so he passed
      me a box of tea.
      <br /><br />
      On the way there, he told me a bit more about the predecessor who slept on
      the same sofa as me - a fellow Hwa Chong student who wanted to take a
      break in China before heading back to Singapore to perform his 0-0-5
      finance job which paid ‘2-digits’, in other words, over 10 thousand
      dollars. I asked if it was in IB, and he said it was a level about IB. In
      VC, or PE, there is always more research to be done, and the boss can call
      you up anytime. Quant finance as well. He showed me a bit of his
      experimentation with quantitative finance as well, showing me a string of
      conditions to execute trades, which he devised himself by studying the
      historical trading trends. I told him about the Web3 story I heard the
      other day, about my friends dabbling in airdrops, and he said that him
      working a full time job puts him at a position not to do airdrops, but
      trade or invest in long positions instead, which is what he did after
      talking to his friend from Ukraine. We then talked about algorithms and I
      talked about hackathons, including the one that I am about to participate
      in, and how disappointing I thought my team was. He suggested for me to
      talk to more people from polytechnic, especially those who made it to
      university since they had to be the top 10 or 5 percent of their cohort
      which implied that they were smart or doing something right. He claimed
      they were more motivated and had 2 more years of relevant experience as
      well. I agreed. I bade farewell to him, and boarded the train.
      <br /><br />
      I was seated right behind a row of white people, two who I deduce are from
      Eastern Europe, and one from the US. The Europeans seemed to be at
      Tsinghua for a fellowship, while I am not sure what the American was here
      for. Upon further eavesdropping and shoulder surfing, the Europeans were
      astrophysicists, who seemed to have spent quite some time here, judging
      from their grasp of the Chinese language. There were a few times where I
      felt like interrupting their conversation to talk to them, but I did not.
      Instead, I just observed behind the disguise of a non-English speaking
      Asian man, and observed their candid conversation.
      <br /><br />
      They were rather brash, talking about sex extremely loudly, expressing
      their confusion with the Chinese language, commenting on their own
      distinction from the people around them, as the ‘老外’s. They also talked
      about being snubbed by a Chinese guy, which they themselves suspect was
      because they spoke too loudly. I would not disagree, but they thought they
      were not in the wrong because the other Chinese people speak loudly on the
      subway as well. I was really confused and wanted to ask them whether they
      took pride in annoying the locals, or felt that just because the locals
      did something, they had the right to do the same as well. There was
      something just generally off that I felt about their seeming sense of
      entitlement, and while not explicitly expressed, an implicit superiority
      complex over the locals.
      <br /><br />
      I don’t know. Maybe white people just speak this way and I am not
      appreciating their nuance of being white.
      <br /><br />
      I went straight to Dayin at Nanjing Street, where I saw that the photos
      looked more colourful and nicer than what I experienced at Lujiazui. I
      checked in and went into my room, walking through the byzantine corridors
      and getting lost in there for a couple of times. There was a gym there
      with an Olympic barbell, where I did my first deadlift in over a month. At
      that point I was too hungry and went downstairs to grab a bite at a “North
      Korean” BBQ store. It was alright.
      <br /><br />
      I then called 成宇 aka 阿信哥 and asked to grab a drink with me for me to
      wallow in self pity. He immediately agreed and arranged to meet at a KTV
      at Shanghai Circus, where the toilets were really nice. He got a 4-hour
      package deal and 10 bottles of beer, and we sang for 2 hours. He then
      taught me how to place a game with dices, where you have to bet the number
      of numbers between the two players. His female friend joined us
      afterwards, singing and dancing to her Korean songs. They interrogated my
      self-pity and we talked more about speaking English and about Singapore.
      Apparently taking IELTS in Japan and Thailand is easier than doing so in
      China.
      <br /><br />
      I then went back, had a fever and went to sleep.
      <br /><br />
      <a id="day-16">Day 16: 31 May</a>
      <br /><br />
      I woke up at 6.30am for some reason. I don’t remember why I wanted to wake
      up so early. I had a weird fever dream the last night about some work to
      be done and I ended up sleeping with half of my body sticking out of the
      bed. I went down to 7-11 to try getting lozenges but this 7-11 was not 24
      hours. I sat down at the bar, ate 2 panadols, and laid down to catch some
      sleep before the 9.30am kickoff call.
      <br /><br />
      12:32 was the time on my watch. Somehow I managed to sleep through the
      alarm without waking up at all, and I saw a chain of messages from the
      Brainhack group chat. I messed up. At this point I would not have attended
      a single Brainhack call or briefing, so I know zero about the competition.
      I apologised in the group chat, before checking out and taking the train
      down to the Lujiazui hostel where I supposed the Wifi would be stronger. I
      had some Chinese soup takeout and typed out some thoughts into the shared
      Google docs.
      <br /><br />
      By the time we were done with the call, it was about 4pm, and I had a
      hotpot dinner with Zach at Nanjing West. I took a shower, then took my
      leave.
      <br /><br />
      We started the conversation talking about Hwa Chong, and I mentioned that
      I had many regrets in Hwa Chong because I had foregone too many of the
      opportunities that the school had provided to its students. He told me not
      to regret my past, since relishing my adolescence was something
      invaluable. Down the line, we talked a bit more about Hwa Chong again,
      with me expressing my disdain for Hwa Chong students having a lack of
      ambition, but it is his belief that Hwa Chong students are the best
      network to make because they end up becoming key personnel in many sectors
      in public and private sectors.
      <br /><br />
      - Whenever you go to a foreign place make sure you look for all the
      Singaporeans who are embedded into the ecosystem here <br />
      - Does not believe in the NUS student population at large because of their
      priorities<br />
      - Did not think I wanted to be a founder because I did not speak
      passionately enough<br />
      - Benchmark of a founder is his JC HP classmate who deferred for 1 year in
      order to develop his business<br />
      - His business was a B2B solution and he talked to CEO of Salesforce and
      Porsche<br />
      - Very insistent on knowing the purpose of whatever you do <br />
      - Questioned my purpose of networking and building on technical skills<br />
      - Mentioned his involvement with Singapore Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai
      and connecting with the vice president of SingCham Shanghai, who plugged
      him into local events<br />
      - Zach is a penultimate year BBA student who chose to do a BBA because he
      did not want to do PPE for its academic rigour, and did not want to do CS
      because he did not think he was good at mathematics, choosing a BBA
      because ‘he liked money’<br />
      - His inclination towards start ups was because among the options of doing
      a BBA, he did not like investment banking, sales and trading because he
      did not want to make money for others, and he did not want to do
      consulting because the consultants were not involved in the execution of
      the recommendations made. He also mentioned that people in consulting
      claimed to be the industry experts in a field such as AI because they had
      done a few engagements with respect to that topic, and talked to other
      industry experts, which he found ridiculous. <br />
      - China over USA because (1) he thinks it is more difficult to enter China
      without someone like NUS to help you, (2) it is better to learn from the
      mistakes made by the government than to enjoy its success, (3) he wanted
      to experience the scale of things, and (4) China’s proximity to Singapore
      makes it inevitable for us to have to deal with the Chinese again soon, so
      it would be good to understand the culture earlier on. <br />
      - International relations are becoming increasingly important to know and
      navigate as future businesspeople, and he recommends to read George Yeo’s
      Musings as he gives a candid recount of his political career. Other
      politicians may be more conservative when doling out information. Apart
      from George Yeo, he also sometimes reads Bilahari Kausikan’s Facebook page
      for his occasional commentary. <br />
      - When I recounted my fearful encounters with Yi Xuan, Tian Lang and
      William, he laughed it off and said it was a good practice round, and that
      it was important to improve on one’s tact, since people like to be around
      other people who make them feel good. He then recommended for me to work
      in China since a lot of the Chinese operate in ‘context-driven’
      environments, quoting sayings such as the true business being done outside
      of the meeting rooms and inside of the KTVs and bars, and that most things
      that the Chinese say have double meanings and you would always have to
      second guess whatever the other person is saying.
      <br /><br />
      // The conversation was much longer than this, but I did not type it all
      out in time while it was still recent. I would say that this conversation
      was one of the most impactful ones I had during this trip.
      <br /><br />
      I took another walk around the West Nanjing food area, because I had
      noticed a street sparsely populated with bars and was interested to see if
      there was anything going down on a Friday night. I saw that there was
      basically nothing going on. I walked back to the station, got myself
      another cup of milk tea, and then went back to the hostel. I was on my
      computer in the main hall of the hostel, when a Mr Beast’s Chandler
      looking man took a seat beside my laptop while I was gone. I learnt that
      he was a graphic designer from Sao Paolo, Brazil, who had spent the last
      few months exploring the Middle East and Asia region, and China was his
      final stop, departing for Brazil from Beijing. He had taken an odd path of
      travel, travelling in an anti-clockwise direction over the sea, instead of
      following the landmass. I advised him what the Shanghai lady had advised
      me on the first day - book early. He gave me his WeChat and I tried
      helping him book a couple of things, but it was too late for him to book
      some of them. He had to resort to booking with tour groups which were
      considerably more expensive. He thanked me, and before the end of the
      night, I found out his name was Gustavo.
      <br /><br />
      <a id="day-17">Day 17: 1 Jun</a>
      <br /><br />
      I woke up, got on the train, and went down to Nanjing West Road. I got on
      a bike, cycled down 3 streets and found the 豆浆油条 place which Zach had
      recommended as authentic in its offerings. I asked for one 豆浆 and one
      油条, and the lady hastily handed me both in a bag. I was confused,
      because in no part of my order did I say it was takeaway. I then ordered
      another set, specifying it was for here, and then she pointed for me to
      have a seat at the side of the road. I was confused, but she later set up
      a table for me to have my breakfast, with the soy milk served in a
      dog-bowl-like bowl, and the dough fritter in a surgery-like tray. The
      spoon said “I love you” on it, and a part of the scoop was chipped off.
      The table was unstable and shook, spilling some of the soy milk on the
      table. This was all part of the authentic Chinese experience, I thought to
      myself.
      <br /><br />
      When I was done, I got up and topped up what I had on hand to make 2 sets,
      bringing them back to Mei and Jay for breakfast. Jay only had the soy milk
      I bought for him because he woke up at 5pm, a good 7 hours after I had
      bought the food.
      <br /><br />
      I hopped onto the call to discuss the hackathon matters. I asked Mei to
      recommend me some food to eat. She got me fish noodles, insisting that
      there is a difference between 面 and 粉, which upon inspection, the
      noodles were differently coloured, with white, yellow and pink noodles in
      the mix. The fish also had bones in it, one of which I had swallowed
      because I felt it pricking against my throat as it went down.
      <br /><br />
      I spent the rest of the afternoon doing up the architecture diagram, which
      I had convinced the team to let me handle by myself. When I was done, I
      took a seat with Gustavo, who had just come back from exploring Yuyuan
      Gardens, and was taking a break before heading out for the night. I told
      him I wanted to go see the nightlife that night because it was a Saturday,
      and he asked if he could come along. Sure, having a white guy would be
      really useful. I told him I wanted to leave in half an hour’s time from
      then, after I had taken a shower, but he said he wanted to rest and pack
      his items, so we decided on leaving separately.
      <br /><br />
      After I was done showering, I saw a blonde white guy reading on his iPad.
      I just sat down and asked him if he were German. Of course he was. He was
      a 22 year old software engineering student who attends one of the better
      institutions in Germany close to Stuttgart. He majored in Embedded
      Systems, and was in China with the Chinese subsidiary of a German company
      located in Suzhou. He mainly coded in the low level languages such as C
      and C++. I asked him if he wanted to go drink later tonight, and he
      agreed, saying he wanted to wait for his friend with whom he was working.
      I found out that he was interested in reading Camus and playing chess,
      both intellectual activities so I called him a smart guy. He said he
      supposed I would call myself one as well. I replied that I don’t say it in
      the open. I told him about the utility of white people in China, then
      probed him a bit more about his family background, inadvertently asking
      him about money which Zach told me was a taboo just yesterday. He said it
      was fine and he did not mind it, but I supposed he was not.
      <br /><br />
      His friend came and they introduced themselves by name. The blonde was
      Flo, and the dark haired one was Fabian. Kind of like Fabio, and both do
      not have Italian ancestry. They both decided to take a shower before
      leaving, so I waited for a bit more before we left.
      <br /><br />
      Flo wanted to go to some Old Shanghai street to get cheap food. I saw that
      the closest station was Yuyuan, so I brought him to the train station, and
      we went there. We passed through the Yuyuan Garden area, taking a few
      pictures of the old Chinese architecture lighted up, and got some
      pineapple tarts for ourselves. We continued walking and could not find
      food, instead finding ourselves at The Bund again. We turned back, wanting
      to go back to Yuyuan Garden, but I forgot to take a turn and we ended up
      eating at a noodle house instead.
      <br /><br />
      Gustavo met us at the noodle house, and I ordered food for everyone. An
      incredulous Chinese auntie came over and stared intently at the white
      guys, before I broke the silence asking what was up. She briefly conversed
      with the white people with myself as the translator, before I offered for
      her to take a photo with the white people. She ecstatically agreed, saying
      she would put it up on the store front. I took the photo on some Douyin
      like app, and we left not long after the interaction. We got ourselves
      some alcohol at a nearby vices supermarket, where I asked if the
      supermarket could show the foreigners some Moutai. He gladly agreed and
      said that Chairman Mao drank 2 bottles of Moutai, and that Moutai would
      make you fly. They laughed and we left. Gustavo asked what the Shanghai
      cream was, and I told him it was for whitening your skin.
      <br /><br />
      We took a cab down to the INS place, which was considerably crowded. We
      went to the place which Kai recommended, but it was too expensive for the
      Germans. I then asked them if they wanted the 6-in-1 package deal for 250
      yuan, which they agreed to. I brought them in, and we let the party begin.
      <br /><br />
      There was a pair of girls from Colombia University studying data science
      who I found pretty cute in the club but honestly I was too buzzed and it
      was too dark to be able to pass a confident judgement. That was just on
      the first floor.
      <br /><br />
      <a id="day-18">Day 18: 2 Jun</a>
      <br /><br />
      We went up to the second floor. I vomited and basically kept falling
      asleep everywhere. At a certain point, breathing was laborious in a room
      full of smokers, so I took a break outside to take a breather. I went back
      upstairs and could not stand the extremely loud music, putting on my
      AirPods and listening to piano music. It was so loud that I could even
      feel my pants vibrating from the bass. I spent the rest of the night sober
      on the dance floor, trying my best to vibe with the music, but I could
      not. I just squatted outside the club for a bit, stood around for a bit,
      and then bumped into Flo. He was conked out. I told him that I would
      extract Fabian from the club, and after a few backs and forth I went in to
      pull him out. We were debating on whether they wanted to stay longer, when
      some white-ish looking cougar put her hand on the wall beside Flo’s face.
      He could not understand what was going on, but I could. I told her not
      today and asked her to go away, but she looked at me disgustingly, before
      putting her other arm on the wall on the other side of Flo’s face. I was
      like damn this lady fierce, and fiercely in love with Flo. He still could
      not understand what was going on and Fabian was trying to get her off as
      well. I prodded her cellulite filled arm, shouting that he had a
      girlfriend, and Fabian joined in, and finally she backed off, gazing
      lovingly at Flo. We decided it was time to go. I took the drink from Flo’s
      hand and desperately tried to find somewhere to leave the glass, and I
      just left it on the bouncer’s rostrum.
      <br /><br />
      We walked to the side of the road and called for a cab, Flo in a drunken
      stupor saying the most random stuff like calling Gustavo a pussy for
      leaving early. I told the pair to have a seat, and directed them to a pair
      of girls on the side of the road. Flo started off with his “我家有四口人”
      shit to the girls, and I tried to translate before the Chinese girl said
      that she could not understand me. I was stupefied by that statement.
      Nevertheless, Flo got to talk with the Chinese girl while Fabian got to
      talk with the supposedly Japanese girl, who was the prettier of the pair.
      She kind of looked like Xue Zhen and she was dressed rather scantily, as
      her top hung rather low and exposed a lot of her chest. Fabian spoke to
      her in English throughout whereas I was busy entertaining Flo, and at the
      end of the night both of them had exchanged contacts with both girls. We
      missed our first cab because of those girls, and I called for a second
      one. I told them to re-engage those girls, but they did not have much time
      to do it because the driver called and we were off.
      <br /><br />
      Flo vomited out of the car window and on his arm. We could not see the
      side of the car, but judging from his arm, I was already dreading the
      aftermath. I apologised to the driver, while Fabian offered to pay for the
      cleaning. I told the driver I would run back into the hostel and wash away
      the vomit from the side of his car. Fabian said he would extricate Flo
      from the car while I was at it. I ran back to the hostel, got 2 bottles of
      water and a disposable towel, and got to cleaning the car door.
      Essentially half of the door was covered by his vomit, as well as a bit of
      the parts beside it. It was not a good time cleaning up the vomit, but
      according to the driver, it would have been 300 yuan if I did not. The
      driver was rather happy by my initiative to clean the car, and so he said
      that we could just pay 160 yuan instead. “Could we put it at a round 150?”
      “Okay.” My only successful negotiation this trip.
      <br /><br />
      We got back to the hostel, Fabian got Flo washed up, had a scare that Flo
      had lost his phone, then went to sleep.
      <br /><br />
      I woke up at 8 after 4 hours of sleep, to jio Jay for breakfast. He
      offered to buy a wrap for me, and he went out to get it. The wrap was
      so-so, with a distinct lack of vegetables inside it which made the whole
      wrap taste quite dry. The savoury sauce drizzled within it was its saving
      grace. I could only eat half of the whole wrap, and Jay passed the other
      half to the other colleague. I asked him about CPF and he said that he
      only had to pay CPF if his pay was above 5000 yuan per month.
      <br /><br />
      I got on the call once again, disconnecting here and there and decided on
      the next steps. I once again got the easy end of job, only having to write
      out the script for the 1 minute elevator pitch.
      <br /><br />
      I got off the call and offered Flo and Fabian to get lunch, and asked the
      front desk for recommendations and a phone to buy the food with. Some
      complicated maths went on and I decided to just get set meals for all of
      us. Flo paid for my meal, I shook hands with him, and went to sleep for a
      few more hours.
      <br /><br />
      When I woke up, I decided to just relish my last night in Shanghai and
      China in general. I took a shower and got on a bike, cycled to Lujiazui
      and had a good walk around the area, visiting the Oriental Pearl, walking
      round the roundabout and visiting the Shanghai tower’s base. It all felt
      too familiar as I was there just 4 years ago with Dylan, En Ting and
      friends, and I could remember seeing all those places. They barely changed
      one bit, so I was not that hurried to take pictures with those monuments,
      because I could come back at a different time to take pictures with them,
      probably in a better state of mind and with people I love.
      <br /><br />
      That night, I woke up a couple of times because I wanted to join in on
      tables sitting out there and maybe talk to girls, but I thought about what
      Zach said. What was the goal of doing something like this? None. I went
      back to sleep.
      <br /><br />
      Shanghai reminds me of what Ali said about these places just being ‘brick
      and mortar’, whereas people’s lives change so much in between the span of
      years. This might just be a call for me to cherish the people around me,
      and to perhaps go North to see the Aurora Borealis sometime soon.
      <br /><br />
      I think my current goal shall be to utilise Web3 to make enough money to
      bring the 3 of us there.
