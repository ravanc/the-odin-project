          Why I decided to take the risk of going overseas for a week before
          finals.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout JC, I have only failed 1 test. And it wasn't even a test.
          It was a Dynamics Quiz which didn't count for anything. My point is, I
          had studied my JC syllabus through and through, doing almost all the
          practices that were given to me. Guess what - of course I got straight
          A's. I scored near the highest in the class for Physics, Maths and
          Econs, but I realised that that did not make the A on my transcript
          any bigger. Looking back at my JC experience post-JC, I regretted not
          capitalising on the many opportunities that were presented to
          students, instead spending time doing those little extra practice
          booklets for no reason.

          Come university, CS is really stressful because of how many smart and
          competitive people there are in the course. This spurred the JC
          behaviour of wanting to study day in, day out.
        </p>

          A sea change happened when I asked someone why he was watching anime
          instead of doing schoolwork. He said to me "80/20 principle". I mean,
          I have heard of the 80/20 principle, and I thought that it was
          bullshit. But as I continued reflecting about it, taking my JC
          experience into account, I found that he was right. There is not much
          point for me to push hard past the 20% effort necessary, to compete
          for the meagre 10 or so marks that the extra 80% of effort confers
          you. And in a cohort of 900 sweaty people, you know for sure there
          will be at least a hundred of them pushing well into that 80%. No
          thank you, I can settle with setting myself up with a 90 percentile
          cap.

          But I could wax lyrical about how I don't want to study, and be a
          hypocrite and study 24/7 anyways. So, when I was presented the option
          to go over to Hong Kong for my birthday, I saw the grandest
          opportunity for me to put my money where my mouth is. I told my mom,
          "grades don't matter", and agreed to go for 6 days. Words can describe
          how daunted I was by that prospect, but I won't.
        </p>

          Having 3 days in Singapore before the start of my finals, was an
          imposed limit on myself on how much effort I could put in, which I
          hoped was the critical 20%. The rest I leave to whatever god there is.
          (I won't lie, I studied for 1.5 days while I was in HK as well).
        </p>

        <p>
          I entered the finals the next week, and completed all of them
          satisfactorily. And I am not someone who is easily satisfied. But with
          the amount of days that I have put into studying, I felt my
          performance was fine.
        </p>

        <p>
          I gleaned 2 things from this experiment. First, is that focus is
          extremely important if you are ambitious. Hunkering down and focusing
          for the 4 days was really productive. I would have died if I were as
          unfocused as some of the people I saw in the library while I was
          studying. Second, it is so possible for me to pursue other things,
          even in this CS economy. I will never believe myself again if I were
          to say I do not have time, because I managed to squeeze 4 days out of
          my reading week, and throw it into the wind. Imagine the multitude of
          things that could have been done with those 4 days.

          <strong>tl;dr:</strong> do 80/20 principle. devote the other 70-80% of
          your energy to your extracurricular pursuits. it will look better than
          the A you achieved by only studying (if portfolio is your goal).
          otherwise just be happy.
